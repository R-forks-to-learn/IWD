L'Erin també va ajudar a crear R-Ladies Global. Vine i aprèn machine learning amb nosaltres! </p> <p>Aquesta trobada és una trobada conjunta de R-Ladies i PyLadiesBCN, recolzada per la Comissió d’Igualtat de la Facultat de Matemàtiques i  Informàtica de l'UB que ens cedeix una sala.</p> <p><b>És millor venir amb el vostre portatil, cargat, si voleu utilizar els paquets quan parla l'Erin, i millor si installeu el paquet h2o (es diu el mateix en Python i R) abans de venir.</b></p> <p>********************************************************</p> <p>The focus of this talk is scalable machine learning using the H2O <a href=""http://www.h2o.ai/download/h2o/r"">R</a> and <a href=""http://www.h2o.ai/download/h2o/python"">Python</a> packages.  <a href=""https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3"">H2O</a> is an open source, distributed machine learning platform designed for big data, with the added benefit that it's easy to use on a laptop (in addition to a multi-node Hadoop or Spark cluster).  The core machine learning algorithms of H2O are implemented in high-performance Java, however, fully-featured APIs are available in R, Python, Scala, REST/JSON, and also through a web interface. </p> <p>Since H2O's algorithm implementations are distributed, this allows the software to scale to very large datasets that may not fit into RAM on a single machine. H2O currently features distributed implementations of Generalized Linear Models, Gradient Boosting Machines, Random Forest, Deep Neural Nets, dimensionality reduction methods (PCA, GLRM), clustering algorithms (K-means), anomaly detection methods, among others. The ability to create stacked ensembles, or ""Super Learners"", from a collection of supervised base learners is provided via the <a href=""https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/tree/master/h2o-r/ensemble"">h2oEnsemble</a> R package.</p> <p>R and Python code with H2O machine learning code examples will be demoed live and are <a href=""https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-tutorials#r-tutorials"">available on GitHub</a> for attendees to follow along on their laptops. <b>So please bring a charged laptop if you want to try the code! Please also install the h2o package before coming (h2o package on CRAN, in Python pip install h2o)</b></p> <p>## Speaker Bio</p> <p><a href=""http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~ledell/"">Erin LeDell</a> is a Statistician and Machine Learning Scientist at <a href=""http://www.h2o.ai/"">H2O.ai</a>, the company that produces the open source machine learning platform, <a href=""https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3"">H2O</a>.  She is the author of a handful of machine learning related <a href=""http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~ledell/software.html"">software packages</a>, including the <a href=""https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/tree/master/h2o-r/ensemble"">h2oEnsemble</a> R package for ensemble learning with H2O.

As unidades de tais amostras muito provavelmente possuirão pesos amostrais diferentes e este peso deve ser incorporado na análise. O pacote survey foi criado com o objetivo de incorporar esses pesos tanto na análise descritiva quanto em análises mais sofisticadas como regressão. Na palestra, se falará brevemente sobre o cálculo de pesos amostrais, sobre a diferença entre amostragem estratificada e por conglomerados e se mostrará exemplos de análises com o survey.</p> <p>Bio: Vanessa é bacharel em Estatística e tem mestrado e doutorado em Epidemiologia. É professora da UFRGS, ministrando a disciplina de Amostragem, entre outras. Usa o R desde a graduação e este é seu software favorito.

É muito comum encontrarmos colunas com categorias não padronizadas, como, por exemplo, uma variável Estado com “SP”, “sp”, “Sao Paulo”, “São Paulo” etc, todas indicando o mesmo estado.<br/>O R possui várias funções para manipular textos (ou strings). No entanto, as funções do base não possuem uma interface consistente e cada uma tem a sua forma de passar os parâmetros, dificultando a programação durante a análise.<br/>Pensando nisso, Hadley Wickham deu aquela força para a comunidade R e criou o pacote stringr, que possui uma sintaxe consistente, permitindo o usuário manipular textos com muito mais facilidade.</p> <p>Fonte: <a href=""http://material.curso-r.com/stringr/"" class=""linkified"">http://material.curso-r.com/stringr/</a></p> <p>Bio: Mobile Developer, apaixonada por linguagens de programação e tecnologias.

Good data visualisation helps us to swim, digest the data, and learn about our world. The statistics community creates visualisation systems within the context of data analysis, so the graphics are designed to support and enrich the statistical processes of data exploration, modeling, and inference. With open data and open source software, the world is your oyster. </p> <p>Di Cook is Professor of Business Analytics in the Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics at Monash University. She is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association. Her research is in data visualisation, exploratory data analysis, multivariate methods, data mining and statistical computing. She is currently working on bridging the gap between statistical inference and exploratory graphics, using crowd-sourcing experiments with Amazon's Mechanical Turk, and examining the reading of data plots using eye-tracking equipment. She is actively involved in developing open source software including xgobi, ggobi, and several R packages, nullabor, tourr, ggbio and ggenealogy.

During this time, she worked on many diverse research projects and developed an interest in the biology of lactation. She began her PhD at Monash in 2007 on a Department of Primary Industries project investigating the expression and regulation of a gene family involved in the production of a subset of milk oligosaccharides that are of interest in infant nutrition. She currently works as a Postdoctoral Scientist in the bioinformatics group at Murdoch Childrens Research Institute. Dr Maksimovic currently works on the analysis of epigenetic data, with a focus on methylation, particularly in immune cells.</p> <p><b>Title:</b> Some of my new favourite things for working with R</p> <p><b>Abstract:</b> As a bioinformatician, I analyse different types of high-dimensional data to answer biological questions. My work requires a lot of data exploration and is often highly iterative. R markdown has become indispensable for keeping my projects organised, reproducible and maintaining version control. However, when working with large datasets involving lots of plots, it was tedious to have to render an entire document to see the results of changes to a single plot. Alternatively, each plot had to be refined on its own, which was acceptable but could become error prone when preceding code was changed. The recent introduction of R notebooks in RStudio 1.0.0 has revolutionised how I work with R markdown. The ability to view plots/results in the source has made editing easy and robust, whilst retaining all the reproducibility and version control perks of traditional R markdown. My recent discovery of the aheatmap function in the NMF CRAN package has also made my life a lot easier by drastically simplifying the code require to create an informative heatmap.  </p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>Natalia Da Silva </b>is a Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at Iowa State University working with Dianne Cook and Heike Hofmann. She completed her M.S. in Statistics at Iowa State University working in network meta-analysis with  Bayesian inference in Spring 2014 and received a double  B.S. in Economics (Spring 2009) and in Statistics (Spring 2008) at University of the Republic (Montevideo, Uruguay). Her Ph.D. thesis topic is bagged projection methods for supervised classification in big data. She is interested in data mining, prediction, exploratory data analysis, statistical graphics, reproducible research and meta-analysis. </p> <p>She enjoys being outdoors and her favorite season is summer, therefore she is happy to be in Australia then.</p> <p><b>Title:</b> Interactive graphics for visually diagnosing forest classifiers in R.</p> <p><b>Abstract:</b> This talk describes structuring data and constructing plots to explore forest classification models interactively. A forest classifier is an example of an ensemble, produced by bagging multiple trees. The process of bagging and combining results from multiple trees, produces numerous diagnostics which with interactive graphics can provide a lot of insight into class structure in high dimensions. Various aspects are explored in this talk, to assess model complexity, individual model contributions, variable importance and dimension reduction, and uncertainty in prediction associated with individual observations. The ideas are applied to the random forest algorithm, and to the projection pursuit forest, but could be more broadly applied to other bagged ensembles. Interactive graphics are built in R, using ggplot2, plotly, and shiny packages.</p> <p>Sign up now!! </p> <p>We are looking forward to seeing you,</p> <p>R-Ladies Melbourne</p> ","https://www.meetup.com/rladies-melbourne/events/237490455/"

So we invited him to share his knowledge with R-Ladies and he kindly accepted our invitation. Here are the details of his talk.</p> <p><b>Title:</b> Building easy and interactive dashboards in R with flexdashboard </p> <p><b>Abstract:</b> Outputs of analyses or analytics pipelines often contain visualisations, summarised data and commentary around it. While this can be achieved using multiple methods such as good old fashioned Powerpoints, RMarkdowns or Shiny Apps; the good folks at R Studio have given analysts and data scientists a new alternative via a package called flexdashboard. Find out how easy it is to build flexible, attractive and interactive dashboards with R. </p> <p><b>Speaker:</b> Kaushik Lakshman is a data scientist and a big fan of R. He works at Betfair Australia, the world's largest betting exchange. He came across the flexdashboard package a few months ago and has already implemented a few in his organisation. He was enamoured by its ease of use and value it provided and would like to share that with the R Ladies group. He's going to take us through flexdashboards and its different features, with examples and code Betfair's after which all attendees hopefully are in a position to create their own dashboards with ease.</p> <p>Signup now!</p> <p>Looking forward to seeing you all,</p> <p>R-Ladies Melbourne</p> ","https://www.meetup.com/rladies-melbourne/events/238178118/"

If you are developing a software or working on scripts in your day-to-day tasks, you would have realised that you need a tool that would allow you to keep track of all the changes you make to the project throughout the development process without requiring you to duplicate files and make copies of them. Such a tool would ideally also allow you to revert any recent changes to the script to the old ones or previous versions. This is called Version Control and Git is one such a tool that provides this facility. I will be introducing basic concepts in Version Control and demonstrate how to use Git in your routine analysis.</p> <p>The second event will be on 22nd of May so add it to your calendar if you are interested in hands-on Twitter Sentimental Analysis!!

It is important to understand how such extreme events have affected global food production in the past in order to increase the resilience of the global food system to such events in the future. In this presentation, I will talk about how random forests - a machine learning algorithm - can help to detangle the complex interactions between climate and agricultural variables. In the first part of this presentation, I will introduce the concept of random forests, how they are used for regression and classification problems and how to build random forests in R using the randomForest package. In the second part I will talk about how I applied random forests to global climate and agricultural datasets to look at how climate extreme events affected agricultural production.</p> <p>This month is also R-Ladies Melbourne first anniversary!

In addition, interactive data manipulation enables to study the behaviour of a mathematical model, as the parameters of the model are being modified which can be helpful for example in developing interactive education materials.It is even used by newspapers like the New York Times and scientific papers like Science.</p> <p>R shiny is an excellent framework to turn an R analysis into an interactive web application and we will be presenting a two-hour introductory workshop to build interactive apps with R Shiny.</p> <p>In this workshop, we will cover the structure of R Shiny Apps, and the concept of reactivity, where an 'event' such as changing the value of the input or selecting a row in a table, triggers a set of reactions and results in updating the output value. We will also briefly talk about ways to publish and distribute an app publicly.</p> <p>A little about Marie and Soroor:</p> <p>Marie graduated from the Institut National des Sciences Appliquées de Toulouse in France in the major of engineering and mathematics, and got her PhD degree on System Biology and Structural Biology Modeling from the Centre for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona. Marie has joined Terry Speed lab’s as a Postdoctoral research fellow about a year ago, in the Bioinformatics Division at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research.</p> <p>Soroor is a Research Assistant in Davis laboratory, also in the Bioinformatics Division at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. She joined Davis laboratory in 2014 as a UROP student, and was promoted to a RA in 2016. She is currently doing a part-time masters degree in Statistics at the University of Melbourne.</p> <p>This will be a fantastic workshop and we can't wait to see you all there!</p> <p>Pizza and drinks will be provided!</p> <p>R-Ladies Melbourne</p> ","https://www.meetup.com/rladies-melbourne/events/244773109/"

After returning home to Melbourne, she took up a role at Public Transport Victoria in Operational Performance Analysis.<br/>At PTV Belinda used R to plot the location of stations, stops and timing points and the paths of public transport routes. She created dashboards containing spatial visualisations of Victorian public transport operational performance data.<br/>Belinda now works at Swinburne University, using in R and Tableau on data which is (unfortunately) not about trains.

This data is publicly available on the PTV website. This talk will cover working with GTFS spatial data to plot maps in R, using the leaflet and sp packages. Belinda will explain how to create zoomable maps of transport paths and stations, and mention some of the challenges of working with this dataset.</p> <p>This meetup is hosted by our wonderful sponsor Zendesk, who will be provided pizza and drinks for us for the evening!</p> <p>We can't wait to see you all there!</p> <p>R-Ladies Melbourne</p> ","https://www.meetup.com/rladies-melbourne/events/247262918/"

Here is the first of our two events in September!</p> <p>Our speaker will be Saras Windecker, who will tell us about reproducibility and containerisation in R.</p> <p>Research using R underpins a wide array of applied decision-making. Growing recognition of irreproducibility of results produced using R raises concerns about the credibility of research and the reliability of decisions they inform. Although there are many aspects to reproducible research, one major problem is the basic lack of computational reproducibility of published work – or the ability to rerun an analysis and reproduce the same results. There are many strategies for improving computational reproducibility, such as clear code structure, functional programming, and version control. Besides these tactics, however, we often find that analyses that reproduce on one machine or in one environment do not run in another, or do not run in the future. This problem is related to changing computing environments and software versions, and can be addressed using containerisation. In this talk, I will introduce containerisation and its implementation using an open-access R package. This introduction should be accessible to those who have never heard of or used containerisation before, as well as those who already actively use services such as Docker for containerisation.</p> <p>Saras Windecker is a Research Fellow in Ecological Modeling at the School of BioSciences, University of Melbourne. She is currently working on spatial risk modelling for Buruli ulcer in Victoria, and is more broadly interested in applied Bayesian hierarchical models, forecasting, and open science.</p> <p>Saras' talk will be hosted by our fantastic sponsor Zendesk.

As R is becoming more accessible and useful in this regards, it is becoming a more viable alternative to Microsoft Excel and other spreadsheet-based applications for wrangling, analysing and visualising data. This has resulted in more R-users who are not from the ""hardcore"" STEM disciplines - like linguists, psychologists and researchers in political science.

Please find below the instruction to download TensorFlow.</p> <p>The talk will take place on the ground level, Hanna Neumann (MSI) building (building 145) on the ANU campus. There will be refreshments in foyer at 5.15 pm, and the talk will start at 6 pm. After the talk, there will be a dinner at China Plate, Kambri precinct ANU. Please RSVP SSA Canberra ([masked]) or R-Ladies Canberra ([masked]) by 27 May if you would like to attend the dinner.</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>Geostatistics plays a key role in the analysis and prediction of spatial and spatio-temporal phenomena. Spatial/spatio-temporal model fitting generally involves multiple matrix operations that can be slow to execute on a CPU. RStudio's interface to TensorFlow provides an ideal vehicle for doing spatial model fitting on a GPU in a fraction of the time needed by a CPU.</p> <p>I will first briefly talk about Google's TensorFlow and the associated R interface. I will then derive the maximum likelihood estimator for the parameters in a simple spatial model and implement maximum-likelihood estimation in R. Finally, I will show how to implement the same fitting procedure using Google's TensorFlow and illustrate the speed improvement when using a GPU. Attendees are invited to bring their own laptop with R and TensorFlow installed (see <a href=""https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tensorflow/articles/installation.html"" class=""linkified"">https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tensorflow/articles/installation.html</a>).</p> <p>Biography:<br/>Andrew Zammit Mangion is Senior Lecturer and DECRA Research Fellow in the National Institute for Applied Statistics Research Australia (NIASRA), University of Wollongong, Australia. He is a co-author of two books and he has published over 20 peer-reviewed articles in the field of spatial and spatio-temporal statistics. He is also the author of a number of related R packages available on CRAN, including EFDR, FRK, and IDE. In 2013, Andrew was awarded a US National Academy of Sciences prize for his work on the modelling and prediction of armed conflicts.</p> ","https://www.meetup.com/rladies-canberra/events/261395008/"

In our morning workshop, you will learn how to share and communicate your findings with yourself and others using R Markdown. As you go further on your journey with R, you will write functions that you use to perform common tasks. In the afternoon workshop, you will learn how put these together into an R package, which makes them easier to use and very easy to share.</p> <p>R Markdown (morning session, 9:30am to 12:30pm)<br/>Presented by Nick Tierney<br/>For a scientific report to be completely credible, it must be reproducible. The full computational environment used to derive the results, including the data and code used for statistical analysis should be available for others to reproduce. R Markdown is a tool that allows you integrate your code, text and figures in a single file in order to make high quality, reproducible reports. A paper published with an included R Markdown file and data sets can be reproduced by anyone with a computer. After completing this course, you will know how to:<br/>- Create your own R Markdown document<br/>- Create figures and tables that you can reference in text, and update with - your data<br/>- Export your R Markdown document to PDF, HTML, and Microsoft Word<br/>- Use keyboard shortcuts to improve workflow<br/>- Cite research articles and generate a bibliography</p> <p>Building R packages (afternoon session, 1:30pm to 5pm)<br/>Presented by: Damjan Vukcevic<br/>You have developed a new statistical method. Now it is time to share it with the world. The methods that actually get used in practice are those with readily available and user-friendly implementations. Writing and disseminating software is therefore a key skill for modern statisticians, one that is generally not taught widely. This course aims to fill the gap. The R software environment is widely used for statistical analyses. One of its distinguishing features is the extensive range of R ‘packages’, which anyone can write and share via the internet. This used to be an intimidating process but modern tools have made it simple.</p> <p>We begin our course with how to write a very basic package, and then show how to include documentation, examples and data. Further topics include: an efficient development workflow, managing relationships between packages, sharing your packages with others, and easy ways to manage packages (finding, installing, upgrading).</p> ","https://www.meetup.com/rladies-canberra/events/262429355/"

In this talk we will discuss ways to give visual statistical methods an inferential framework. Statistical significance of ""graphical discoveries"" is measured by having the human viewer compare the plot of the real dataset with collections of plots of null datasets: plots take on the role of test statistics, and human cognition the role of statistical tests, in a process modeled after the ""lineup"", popular from criminal legal procedures. This is a simple but rigorous protocol that provides valid inference, yielding p-values for graphical findings. The procedure can also be used to objectively decide the best choice of graphical display of the same data, for communicating information.</p> <p>Biography</p> <p>Dianne Cook is Professor of Business Analytics at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.

Literate projects are not only more pleasant to work on -- they are also easier for others to discover and explore. In my experiences as a researcher and now a data scientist at RStudio, I've had the pleasure to work on many literate projects, and I've felt the pain of working on illiterate ones too. What is the difference? What are the benefits?

How do you do this?</p> <p>This talk by Merelda Wu distills the art form of ""talking to business"" to a list of non-scientific formulas that can be applied in your everyday life.<br/>If any of the following resonates with you, join us:</p> <p>1. The magic wand problem? Data doesn’t just give you “actionable insight”, you need to ask the right question.<br/>2. Misaligned expectations? The classic case of what you say you want, is not what you really, really want.<br/>3. The scope creep problem? Sure, of course I can re-write everything and give it to you five minutes ago.<br/>4. The big data problem? No darling, you don’t have big data if it fits in Excel.<br/>5. The confidence challenge? No, there’s no such thing as 100% accurate, also we use this thing called the F1 score.<br/>6. The cloud challenge? Yes cloud would be great, but your data's gotta be there first though.</p> <p>This talk shares some common problems faced in most data science projects.

In all of those systems I was interested in finding out more about cooperation, the social structure enabling it and the genetic basis of this fascinating biological phenomenon. My research is strongly centred on statistics for which I am using R. Having used Mathematica in the beginning, I was missing a neat way to organise my R scripts and to make reports of my findings. After a lot of frustration and literally days of copy-pasting R output into Word documents I discovered RMarkdown a few years ago and I have been using it ever since. Apart from having neater scripts, I ‘knit’ reports of my results as Word or PDF documents, but also presentations and I am trying to do a webpage with RMarkdown. In my free time I play improvisational theatre in Bern in a group which I co-founded.</p> ","https://www.meetup.com/rladies-lausanne/events/254756623/"

For those very new to R or those who have using the tidyverse for a while, you'll still pick up some new tricks.</p> <p>Please arrive at 6:00 for a 6:30 start.</p> <p># Data science in the tidyverse</p> <p>The talk will begin with a broad overview of the data science process, motivated by a simple, but compelling, example. The bulk of the talk will cover the details of the process, focussing on challenges around data import, tidying, transformation, and visualisation. Along the way you'll learn some of the key principles of the tidyverse, centered around an explicit acknowledgement of the human in the loop.</p> <p>While I'll be showing and talking about lots of code, no programming experience is required. This talk contains no formulas.</p> <p># Bio</p> <p>Hadley is Chief Scientist at RStudio, a member of the R Foundation, and Adjunct Professor at Stanford University and the University of Auckland. He builds tools (both computational and cognitive) to make data science easier, faster, and more fun. His work includes packages for data science (the tidyverse: including ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, purrr, and readr) and principled software development (roxygen2,<br/>testthat, devtools).

She is currently based in London and works for the economics consultancy Oxera where she applies machine learning to strategic projects and is developing the data science and programming team. She is a mentor in the R-Ladies London chapter, uses R on a daily basis to crunch data and problem solve and presented at both UseR! and EARL last year.</p> <p># Dive into dplyr</p> <p>Data is seldom already in a tidy format for you to start analysis on straight away. My personal experience confirms that about 80% of the analytics work-flow is massaging and crunching data into a useful state. R is a master of analytics and modelling which would be useless without its strong data manipulation functionality, especially from the tidyverse package dplyr. In this session we will learn the main verbs of dplyr and link them together with the magrittr pipe to create new data sets and get insight from our data. Then we will take a look at the verb extensions and other package functionality.</p> <p># What to bring</p> <p>The session will be hands on so bring your own laptop with dplyr installed (examples will be based on in-build data sets). If you don't have the set-up, come along anyway to learn about this famous package.</p> <p>This meetup will be aimed at all R abilities.</p> <p>See attached the detailed map to the room.</p> ","https://www.meetup.com/rladies-auckland/events/247162977/"

This rapid increase in popularity is evidenced in the thriving ecosystem of tools and also numerous training initiatives that have sprung up at various institutions.</p> <p>One such effort in this space is the rOpenSci project (<a href=""https://ropensci.org"" class=""linkified"">https://ropensci.org</a>). Founded as a grassroots effort six years ago, the project works to promote open and reproducible research by enabling discovery of data, code and software, creating the technical and social infrastructure to enable reproducible research, and advocate for a culture of open science in various disciplines. This community driven project builds upon R’s popularity as a scientific research tool and fills in additional gaps in the computational pipeline by providing tools for data acquisition (from APIs and other source), data manipulation (including an emerging suite for spatial data analysis and mapping), data visualization tools, and data publication tools. Beyond tooling, the project has been working towards promoting best practices in scientific computing (beyond the R language itself) by developing a highly successful model for peer review of scientific software, mentorship, and community development.</p> <p>In this talk I’ll speak about the history and motivations behind the project, demo some of our recent tools that can streamline your data science workflow, and also talk about our efforts to build community through various initiatives.</p> <p>Thanks to our Sponsors:<br/>- rOpenSci project for food and drink<br/>- GridAKL for sponsoring the venue</p> ","https://www.meetup.com/rladies-auckland/events/247489521/"

In this workshop, we’ll explore what data journalism is, how R helps journalists to tell those data stories, and then collectively hack the code behind a recent story published by RNZ that used data analysis and visualisations as part of the reporting process.</p> <p>Bio: Kate Newton has been a journalist for a decade and is currently a reporter for RNZ’s new In Depth team (<a href=""https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/in-depth/368436/universities-face-a-crisis-of-the-humanities"" class=""linkified"">https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/in-depth/368436/universities-face-a-crisis-of-the-humanities</a>), which focuses on long-form and investigative journalism. Known among her colleagues for being “good at maths” (an extremely low bar in journalism), she has only recently discovered R and its power as a data journalism tool. She is gradually learning and incorporating R into her research and reporting, including publishing her extremely messy code so she can learn from the veterans!</p> <p>What to bring: Laptops. We’ll use Kate’s Github repo (<a href=""https://github.com/katenewtonnz/humanities"" class=""linkified"">https://github.com/katenewtonnz/humanities</a>) , and for anyone who’s interested in learning more about data journalism, The Data Journalism Handbook (<a href=""https://datajournalismhandbook.org/"" class=""linkified"">https://datajournalismhandbook.org/</a>) is a great online resource.</p> <p>As with all our meetups all levels of R welcome, from beginners to regular users.

Pokazacu nekoliko nacina za pristup podacima sa Wikidata iz programskog jezika R, ukljucujuci i lako upotrebljiv paket {WikidataR}. Predstavicu nekoliko Big Data analitickih sistema razvijenih u R koji kroz mašinsko ucenje (topic models - LDA, t-SNE) i vizuelizacije podataka i rezultata (rBokeh, plotly, visNetwork, igraph, dygraphs, Shiny) omogucavaju pracenje semanticke strukture Wikidata. Trudicu se, ipak, da centralna nit mog izlaganja ne bude samo prezentacija razlicitih sistema i rešenja, vec suocavanje sa prakticnim, realnim problemima u Big Data analizama, od kojih - dacu primere - neke efikasnije rešavamo u R (sa dovoljno dobrom hardverskom podrškom, naravno) nego u specijalizovanim Big Data sistemima (poput Spark, koji koristim prakticno samo u ETL fazama). Voleo bih da vam poklonim neke trikove u izracunavanju ogromnih kontingencijskih tabela i metrika u R koji vam mogu poslužiti za razvoj igracaka poput popularnih recommender systems. Konacno, ako mi vreme dopusti, osvrnuo bih se na tipicno savremeno obrazovanje u R za Data Science i zašto smatram da na kraju dana bolje pliva onaj koji je prvo zaista postao R programer, a onda naucio {tidyverse} - koji veoma volim i koristim svakodnevno. Bice i Rmarkdown notebook za sve koji bi voleli da pocnu da uce o pristupu Wikidata iz R. Na kraju, cilj mi je da vam pokažem koliko je svet koji nastanjujemo u Data Science izuzetno zabavan, interesantan i dubok, i zašto ne treba da odustanete od namere da se u njemu profesionalno nastanite!</p> <p>~~~~~~~</p> <p>Dr Goran S. Milovanovic je studirao matematiku, filozofiju, i psihologiju, na Univerzitetu u Beogradu i NYU (SAD), i stekao formalno obrazovanje u eksperimentalnoj i teorijskoj psihologiji u oblasti kognitivnih nauka. Programer je od 80-ih godina i 8-bitnih mašina sa 64K RAM memorije. Njegov put u Data Science zapoceo je proucavanjem probabilistickih modela ljudskih kognitivnih funkcija (kategorizacija i ucenje koncepata, semanticka memorija, kauzalna indukcija, odlucivanje u uslovima rizika i neizvesnosti) i modeliranjem podataka dobijenih bihejvioralnim eksperimenatima. Danas radi u programskim jezicima R i Python, uz podršku raznih drugih tehnologija i standarda (Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, SPARQL, SQL, XML, JSON i drugih). Programski jezik R je njegova pasija i specijalnost. Od 2017. radi kao Data Scientist za projekte Wikidata i Wiktionary sa Wikimedia Deutschland, gde koristi R u analizi nekih od najvecih i najsloženijih skupova otvorenih podataka danas uopšte dostupnih.

For the first 1.5 years in my job, this was a feature, but lately it has felt more like a bug. In this talk I will introduce rOpenSci, our packages, and our system for transparent software peer review, and then share my story of starting to learn R by (not so) passive absorption of information and best practices from R-Ladies, rOpenSci, and the broader R world.</p> <p>Malisa Smith:<br/>Flow cytometry is commonly used by biologists to measure the abundance of specific molecules in millions of cells, while retaining information at the single-cell level. The resulting high-dimensional, high-throughput datasets have led to the development of unique software for analyzing flow cytometry data. I will talk about how I learned to use open source R packages for analyzing flow data, and I hope that my experience will help other people navigate the landscape of flow cytometry analysis tools and online software resources in general.</p> ","https://www.meetup.com/rladies-seattle/events/261245337/"

She is currently based in London and works for the economics consultancy Oxera where she applies machine learning to strategic projects and is developing the data science and programming team. She is a mentor in the R-Ladies London chapter, uses R on a daily basis to crunch data and problem solve and presented at both UseR! and EARL last year.</p> <p># Dive into dplyr</p> <p>Data is seldom already in a tidy format for you to start analysis on straight away. My personal experience confirms that about 80% of the analytics work-flow is massaging and crunching data into a useful state. R is a master of analytics and modelling which would be useless without its strong data manipulation functionality, especially from the tidyverse package dplyr. In this session we will learn the main verbs of dplyr and link them together with the magrittr pipe to create new data sets and get insight from our data. Then we will take a look at the verb extensions and other package functionality.</p> <p># What to bring</p> <p>The session will be hands on so bring your own laptop with dplyr installed (examples will be based on in-build data sets). If you don't have the set-up, come along anyway to learn about this famous package.</p> <p># Important to know</p> <p>This meetup will be aimed at all R abilities.</p> <p>Doors: 6:30pm<br/>Start: 7:00pm<br/>**Please note**: registration for this event is via Eventbrite: <a href=""https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/dive-into-dplyr-tickets-43071163008"" class=""linkified"">https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/dive-into-dplyr-tickets-43071163008</a></p> ","https://www.meetup.com/rladies-london/events/247712800/"

If that wasn't enough, she's also an R-blogger, data enthusiast, organiser of MünsteR, animal lover, ballroom and latin dance teacher! You can read her award-winning blog here: <a href=""https://www.shirin-glander.de/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.shirin-glander.de/</a></p> <p>Shirin will talk about using R to build an interpretable imagine recognition models.</p> <p>ABOUT THE TALK</p> <p>Keras is a high-level open-source deep learning framework that by default works on top of TensorFlow. Keras is minimalistic, efficient and highly flexible because it works with a modular layer system to define, compile and fit neural networks. It has been written in Python but can also be used from within R. Because the underlying backend can be changed from TensorFlow to Theano and CNTK (with more options being developed right now) it is designed to be framework-independent. Models can be trained on CPU or GPU, locally or in the cloud. Shirin will show an example of how to build an image classifier with Keras. We'll be using a convolutional neural net to classify fruits in images. But that's not all! We not only want to judge our black-box model based on accuracy and loss measures - we want to get a better understanding of how the model works. We will use an algorithm called LIME (local interpretable model-agnostic explanations) to find out what part of the different test images contributed most strongly to the classification that was made by our model. Shirin will introduce LIME and explain how it works. And finally, she will show how to apply LIME to the image classifier we built before, as well as to a pre-trained Imagenet model.</p> <p>MEETUP AGENDA</p> <p>18.00 - 19.00: Doors open and networking.<br/>19.00 - 19.15: Intro in the Data Science at Farfetch<br/>19.15 - 20.30: Shirin's talk + questions<br/>~20.30 - ~21.00: networking</p> <p>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS<br/>We would like to say thanks to our sponsor; tech recruitment agency RedCat Digital (<a href=""https://www.redcat-digital.com/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.redcat-digital.com/</a>), and to our hosts global ecommerce platform Farfetch (<a href=""https://www.farfetch.com/uk/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.farfetch.com/uk/</a>).

How?</p> <p>Every Tuesday a raw dataset will be posted and an original chart associated with that dataset. The goal is to apply your take on the chart. While the dataset will be “tamed”, it will not always be tidy! As such you might need to apply various R for Data Science techniques to wrangle the data into a true tidy format. The goal of Tidy Tuesday is to apply your R skills, get feedback, explore other’s work, and connect with the greater RStats community! So everyone of all skills should participate!</p> <p>Remember, done is better than perfect! It's better to show the progression of your skills with something basic but quick than something very sophisticated but tedious!</p> <p>At the end of the meetup we will publish our graphs and code on Twitter with #TidyTuesday hashtag (fanfares)!</p> <p>So get ready for a fun and hands-on meetup with lots to learn and explore!</p> <p>Agenda:</p> <p>5:30pm - doors open (pizza and drinks won't last forever!)</p> <p>6pm - quick intros and hellos from R-Ladies and hosts</p> <p>6:15ish pm - start TidyTuesday-ing!!</p> <p>8:45ish pm - publish our amazing work</p> <p>See you all there!</p> <p>We would like to say thanks to our sponsor tech recruitment agency RedCat Digital and to our hosts online mortgage broker Habito.

As one of several alternative approaches to forecasting future trends using past information, ARIMA is a flexible but also powerful ‘semi-parametric’ method for forecasting and fitting longitudinal (aka panel) data, and there is also a user-friendly R implementation. In contrast to more inferential tools like Cox survival models, ARIMA models can make useful, potentially more accurate forward predictions with relatively sparse datasets, and they can be very useful for surfacing initial evidence of causal trends for further validation.</p> <p>ARIMA can be used for everything from forecasting highly seasonal sales trends for food products, to the main example we’ll work through: surfacing a potential link between delayed discharges of hospitalised NHS patients and the unusual increase in English mortality rates since 2015.</p> <p>The workshop does not presuppose any prior experience with time series/panel data analysis, but it will be helpful to have some statistical background as well as basic R skills. Bring your laptops! Data and code will be circulated on Github.</p> <p>The talk will be given by Jules Shen, who is a statistical consultant with the Health Foundation, working primarily with the Improvement Analytics Unit. She is also a part-time PhD student in public health and policy at the LSHTM, who previously worked in development/health economics and management consultancy.

He is interested in building tools (computational and cognitive) that make data ingest, preparation, manipulation, visualization and analysis easier. He's developed over 30 R packages, for data analysis (ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr), making frustrating parts of R easier to use (lubridate for dates, stringr for strings, httr for accessing web APIs), and for streamlining the R package development (devtools, roxygen2, and testthat).</p> <p>SUMMARY: Dr. Wickham will discuss the benefits for reproducibility on the small scale (e.g. a single scientific paper) which are clear: anything that can be reified and made explicit in code, should be made explicit in code. In this talk, he'll discuss how reproducibility has escaped journal articles in his life and influences almost everything he does. He'll discuss three unexpected venues of reproducibility in his life:</p> <p>1. “Writing reproducible books with bookdown, which allows me to generate html, pdf, and epub versions of the text with a press of a key.”<br/>2. “Writing reproducible blog posts with blogdown, which makes easy to intermingle code and prose in low-stakes explanations of my work.”<br/>3. “Generating reproducible emails to track shared water usage and inform my neighbours when they owe me money!”</p> <p>He'll also touch on the intersection of reproducibility and software development, highlighting best practices like unit testing, code coverage, and continuous integration.</p> <p>Directions/Parking: see details at <a href=""https://melindahiggins2000.github.io/HadleyWickham_Oct2018/"" class=""linkified"">https://melindahiggins2000.github.io/HadleyWickham_Oct2018/</a></p> <p>REGISTER AT THIS LINK ONLY <a href=""https://eventactions.com/eareg.aspx?ea=Rsvp&amp;invite=gwump82y45b2ccrggusxhyp5gcm5v88cn8hdhgkyc4wd1e7whw45"" class=""linkified"">https://eventactions.com/eareg.aspx?ea=Rsvp&amp;invite=gwump82y45b2ccrggusxhyp5gcm5v88cn8hdhgkyc4wd1e7whw45</a></p> ","https://www.meetup.com/rladies-atlanta/events/255370238/"

They’re hidden in every step of the process; funding, data collection, analysis, and visualization are rife with inequality-causing assumptions, misunderstandings, and blind spots. Ethics and equity in data are a critical issue in the present and will continue to grow in importance in the sector. Understanding how to speak to these issues is fundamental for data professionals. Fairness in machine learning and algorithmic accountability are gaining prominence in the literature - but largely from a theoretical point of view. This talk will present a few practical tools and checklists to address the conceptual issues of ethics and equity in data science.</p> ","https://www.meetup.com/rladies-toronto/events/262885065/"

If you were one of them, you might be at the stage that the excitement and joy, from running awesome analyses and generating data visualization in R, have been taken away by being tired of managing scripts and repeatedly doing things. Then, it might be time to consider developing good practices in R.</p> <p>Based on some widely-known online resources and her own experiences, Zhi will go over a wide range of good practices in R including how to use RStudio projects, name files, customize RStudio, create shortcuts, format codes, write functions, and etc. These tips will hopefully help improve your experiences of programming in R to achieve goals of better managing multiple projects and saving your time in the long run.</p> ","https://www.meetup.com/rladies-pasadena/events/257442068/"

Growing recognition of irreproducibility of results produced using R raises concerns about the credibility of research and the reliability of decisions they inform. Although there are many aspects to reproducible research, one major problem is the basic lack of computational reproducibility of published work – or the ability to rerun an analysis and reproduce the same results. There are many strategies for improving computational reproducibility, such as clear code structure, functional programming, and version control. Besides these tactics, however, we often find that analyses that reproduce on one machine or in one environment do not run in another, or do not run in the future. This problem is related to changing computing environments and software versions, and can be addressed using containerisation. In this talk, I will introduce containerisation and its implementation using an open-access R package. This introduction should be accessible to those who have never heard of or used containerisation before, as well as those who already actively use services such as Docker for containerisation.</p> ","https://www.meetup.com/rladies-montpellier/events/262637554/"

Drinks and food included! :D.</p> <p>The program of the day is as follows:</p> <p>5:00 - 5:45 --- First lighting talk: 'R VS PYTHON, The battlefield', by Eva Pardi, Software Developer and Data Analyst @ Laerdal Copenhagen.</p> <p>Let’s dive deeper in the infinite sea of programming languages designed for data scientists and analysts. I do not think, that we are supposed to choose one and live with that for the rest of our lives. So how can we decide which one to use for what purpose?.</p> <p>In this session, we will talk about the first steps of R and Python, for what tasks can these languages be used in the best way, and how. You will be able to try both languages during the session in different environments. We will build some interesting stuff from basic statistical models to some hardcore deep learning algorithms.</p> <p>5:45 - 5:55 --- Break.</p> <p>5:55 - 6:40 --- Second lighting talk: 'Cluster analysis for customer segmentation' by Joselene Marques, Data Scientist @ Justt.</p> <p>You will get a short introduction to customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency and Monetary Value) and a quick start to perform cluster analysis in R.<br/>We start by presenting required R packages for data manipulation, cluster analysis and visualization.<br/>Next, we describe two clustering techniques k-MEANS and SOM (self-organizing map).<br/>Finally, we present the result with lots of insightful (and easy to code) plots.</p> <p>6:40 - 7:00 --- Networking.</p> <p>Don't forget to bring your laptops if you want to experiment a little.</p> <p>RSVP, a.s.a.p. as we only have 30 places available! Looking forward to seeing you soon!</p> <p>Eva, Joselene, Kristina and Diana<br/>RLadiesCPH</p> ","https://www.meetup.com/rladies-copenhagen/events/247538224/"

In the latter task it is particularly relevant to have posterior distributions of individual rankings, since these can provide an evaluation of the uncertainty associated to the estimates, and thus they can avoid unnecessarily spamming the users.</p> <p>I will present a statistical model which works well in these situations, and which is able of flexibly handling quite different kind of data. The Bayesian paradigm allows a fully probabilistic analysis, and it easily handles missing data and cluster estimation via augmentation procedures.<br/>Interestingly, this Bayesian framework has also proved to be useful for genomic data integration, since typically heterogeneous microarray data are available from different sources, and their combination allows both to gain statistical power and to strengthen the biological insight.</p> <p>Valeria Vitelli holds a PhD in statistics from Politecnico di Milano, Italy. She was a postdoc at Ecole Centrale Paris for a year, within a research group funded by Eléctricité de France working on big data problems in the energy sector. She then moved to the University of Oslo, where after a 5 years postdoc period funded from the Norwegian Cancer Society she became associate professor in September 2018. Her experience spans over several areas of mathematics and statistics, including functional data analysis with applications in physiology, machine learning (describing people mobility in dense urbanized areas from mobile phone data), and finally statistical genomics of cancer.</p> ","https://www.meetup.com/rladies-oslo/events/256566088/"

You could talk about…</p> <p>Here is a cool R related thing you might not know about<br/>My favourite R package<br/>I use R in my work because...<br/>The most useful/fun thing I have learned in R recently<br/>My favourite R learning resource is…<br/>Why I ditched excel and learned R (and changed my life forever)</p> <p>… you get the idea. Talks will be informal; slides are optional.

We want to make the blog a space where everyone can share ideas so even R-Ladies who are unable to attend the meetup can benefit from the group. With this in mind, it would be great if talk presenters would be willing to contribute to the blog. In addition, if the idea of a lightning talk terrifies you, but writing a blog about your R journey doesn't sound awful, we would love to hear from you.</p> <p>Check out this post by Dani (<a href=""https://rladiessydney.org/posts/contribute-a-post/"" class=""linkified"">https://rladiessydney.org/posts/contribute-a-post/</a>) re how to contribute.

We couldn’t turn down this opportunity.</p> <p>How do we learn effectively from data? As scientists, engineers and analysts, this is a constant refrain. One answer to this question has traditionally been ""just use big data sets"", yet this is not always practical nor even relevant. In real life, our statistical inferences are restricted not because we have too little data but because we ignore the systematic structure of our data. Only by carefully modelling this structure can we take fully advantage of the data - big or small - available to us.</p> <p>In this course we provide an introduction to the basics of Bayesian inference, and the Stan software used to implement Bayesian methods. The power of this approach lies in the flexibility of Stan - it provides a an expressive modelling language for specifying customised, bespoke models and implementing state-of-the-art algorithms to draw subsequent Bayesian inferences. As an R-Ladies event, the workshop runs through interactive exercises run with RStan, the R interface to Stan.</p> <p>Prerequisites</p> <p>This event is best geared for intermediate/advanced R users. We assume you are interested in Bayesian statistics and are familiar with the basics of calculus and linear algebra. Conceptual understanding of probability theory and conditional probability will be useful; check out content on Michael Betancourt's website.</p> <p><a href=""https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/probability_theory.html"" class=""linkified"">https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/probability_theory.html</a></p> <p><a href=""https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/conditional_probability_theory.html"" class=""linkified"">https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/conditional_probability_theory.html</a></p> <p>In order to participate in the interactive exercises attendees must bring a laptop with R and the latest version of RStan installed (<a href=""https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstan/index.html"" class=""linkified"">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstan/index.html</a>).</p> <p>Please verify that you can run the 8schools model as discussed in the RStan Quick Start Guide (<a href=""https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started"" class=""linkified"">https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started</a>) and report any installation issues on the Stan Forums (<a href=""https://discourse.mc-stan.org"" class=""linkified"">https://discourse.mc-stan.org</a>) as early as possible.</p> <p>For beginners who need help with the above, there will be a pre-Stan Hacky Hour the week before the event.</p> <p>Bring your lunch on Sunday, we will kick off around 12:30 and aim to be done by 5:30pm.</p> ","https://www.meetup.com/rladies-sydney/events/258862116/"

Growing recognition of irreproducibility of results produced using R raises concerns about the credibility of research and the reliability of decisions they inform.</p> <p>Although there are many aspects to reproducible research, one major problem is the basic lack of computational reproducibility of published work – or the ability to rerun an analysis and reproduce the same results. There are many strategies for improving computational reproducibility, such as clear code structure, functional programming, and version control. Besides these tactics, however, we often find that analyses that reproduce on one machine or in one environment do not run in another, or do not run in the future. This problem is related to changing computing environments and software versions, and can be addressed using containerisation.</p> <p>In this talk, Saras will introduce containerisation and its implementation using an open-access R package. This introduction should be accessible to those who have never heard of or used containerisation before, as well as those who already actively use services such as Docker for containerisation.</p> <p>Saras Windecker is an ecologist and postdoctoral fellow with the Quantitative and Applied Ecology Group at the University of Melbourne.

When providing consultative like services to extremely large, risk-averse, enterprises this can greatly restrict one’s ability to quickly get Shiny apps into users’ hands, as engagement of IT can take months if approved at all. We’ll share how the Columbus Collaboratory team overcame these barriers to rapid deployment by coupling R Portable and Electron, a framework for creating native applications with a variety of web technologies. All the tools needed to use Electron for desktop deployment of Shiny apps will be reviewed. We’ll highlight a specific example in which these technologies were used within a large enterprise to completely automate a weekly report. We’ll also share how the app used R Packages such as openxlsx, shinydashboard, RODBC, and Zoo to query an internal database, cleanse data, calculate key metrics, and create a downloadable excel file for dissemination. The best part? This Shiny app was delivered to the end business user as a stand-alone executable.</p> <p>Parking: Park in any spot marked ""Reserved for the Columbus Collaboratory"".

Ele também é formado por tomada de decisão, recomendações, exposição de ideias, etc. A grande questão é: Como expor a minha análise no mercado? Hoje em dia, por exemplo, técnicas como machine learning têm sido bem vistas, mas a análise é mais do que apenas uma boa e eficiente técnica. É preciso saber expor/vender a análise através de relatórios ou dashboards que facilitem a comunicação entre quem está analisando e o público que anseia os resultados. O Shiny é um pacote do R que faz a ponte entre sua análise e uma boa visualização dela. O pacote une também o conceito de existir um servidor onde há processamento e interação com os dados - Server Side - e um local onde são criadas interfaces gráficas recebidas pelo servidor - User Side . O pacote utiliza as linguagens mais usuais de interface gráfica - HTML, CSS e JavaScript – e o mais legal é que você não precisa saber todas elas e ainda assim criar visualizações incríveis apenas usando o R.</p> <p>O encontro será no dia 05/02/2019 no Campus da Praia Vermelha da UFF, Escola de Engenharia, bloco D, Sala 365 (R.

That might be the whole text for some members, or half of chapter one for others. There's no judgement or expectation, we just ask that you do your best!</p> <p>For those comfortable with the majority of the contents, you will be expected to take on leadership roles and mentor those still learning, while those learning should come prepared to ask questions. It's entirely possible that you're a mentor for some chapters, and a learner in others, and that's awesome! The goal is for both learners and mentors to develop a deeper understanding of statistical models and how to apply them to data sets that we use in our research, jobs, and/or hobbies.</p> <p>*** please note *** we will be discussing whether or not the ""OpenIntro Statistics"" text is the text we'd like to use for this meetup in our Slack group.

Now that you are familiar with machine learning techniques, let's put several elements together and put those models in real-life use. Ensemble methods have been developed to address those very complex relationships between predictors and response variables in the presence of several candidate models. Therefore, there is no need to decide for a unique final model if you can combine them all to make more accurate predictions!. Besides this, it is also time to put those prediction models into actual action for users.</p> <p>In this workshop, you will learn about ensemble methods such as voting, bagging, boosting and stacking. You will also be shown how to actually put these models into a shiny app for future use.

Saber cuánto hay que regar es la clave del riego. Se conoce como evapotranspiración (ET) a la combinación de procesos separados por los que el agua se pierde a través de la superficie del suelo (evaporación) y por la transpiración del cultivo.<br/>Se presenta el paquete ""water"" disponible en el repositorio CRAN desde el año 2016. Provee muchas funciones para estimar los parámetros de la ecuaciones de ET desde imágenes satelitales.

Cabernet sauvignon), ubicado en la localidad de Ugarteche, Luján de Cuyo, Mendoza. Se aplicó un análisis multiescalar, mediante la utilización de imágenes satelitales Lansat 8 y Sentinel 2 de alta resolución espacial. El trabajo permitió aplicar una metodología para identificar áreas homogéneas según el índice de vegetación (NVDI) presentes en el predio. La incorporación de esta metodología para la selección de sitios de muestreo análogos en predios de grandes superficies, hacen de esta herramienta informática un producto viable, accesible, de bajo costo y reproducible en cualquier ámbito.</p> <p>12:25 - 13:00 - R en genética - Clusterización de haplotipos<br/>Disertante: Tatiana Sofía Parlanti<br/>Breve bio: Estudiante avanzada de la carrera Licenciatura en Ciencias Básicas con orientación en Matemática, de la FCEN-UNCUYO.<br/>Contenido de la exposición:<br/>En los últimos años se ha incrementado el uso del mapeo asociativo, herramienta estadística que permite identificar regiones específicas del genoma relacionadas con la variación de un carácter fenotípico de interés, como estrategia para identificar QTL.

In practice however, labels are often not available and the labels that we do have are all positive. Where does this data occur and what makes it challenging?

Also, if this would be your first time attending an R-Ladies event, that's great! We're looking forward to seeing new faces :)</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>RSVP necessary!</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>As we will be meeting in a restaurant, we will do a reservation for 20 people.</p> <p>Please RSVP as soon as you know if you're joining, first-come-first-served sort of. If you already RSVPed and for some reason won't be able to attend, cancel your participation and let someone else take your spot (we'll be taking names and setting up a waiting list).</p> ","https://www.meetup.com/rladies-munich/events/248504518/"

If so, how? A case study from last year's elections in Germany.<br/>* How has the German Parliament changed ever since the AfD entered the scene? How do they shape the climate and the processes there? An analysis from the Parliament meetings from the past six months.<br/>* Election trend polls: how reliable are they when predicting election outcomes? A method to summarize results from polls and offer some insights into their estimations and its natural uncertainty.</p> <p>Whether you are new to R or an expert user, work in academics or industry, this is a laid back event to further connect the R-Ladies community in Munich. During the MeetUp, you will have the opportunity to make new friends, freely discuss and practice R together while enjoying some snacks and drinks we provide (but if you feel like bringing something to share, that's great too).</p> <p>Anyone who's interested in R is more than welcome - that means this is not a ""women only"" event.

She got into R by way of a long-time love for the NBA and (fantasy) basketball. When not catering to the every whim of her dogs, she can be found: perusing weird words; indulging her bibliomania; and/or watching, quantifying, and visualizing Archer.</p> <p>Topic: Sustainers of the Tidyverse<br/>Abstract: If a piece of open-source software is to survive its own success, it must have a healthy community of active contributors. The tidyverse, a collection of R packages for data science with a shared underlying design philosophy, has become popular in no small part because of its usability among those who do not consider themselves to be “programmers.” However, this active base of non-developer users has been a fruitful source of contributions as we’ve sought to highlight aspects of contributing to open source beyond committing lines of code. This talk will cover the technical tools, virtual spaces, and social norms that have enabled and empowered community contributions.</p> <p>Find Mara on Twitter: <a href=""https://twitter.com/dataandme"" class=""linkified"">https://twitter.com/dataandme</a></p> <p>Q: Are men welcome to attend this event?<br/>A: Our primary mission is to encourage more women and non-binary individuals to get involved in the R community. ***As such, we strongly encourage that all men who attend this event have a female or non-binary sponsor, as spots may be limited.

In this talk, attendees will learn about using animation in data visualizations in R using ggplot2 and gganimate. Topics will include: how to choose when an animation might (or might not) be an appropriate option for your use case, ways to make sure your visualization still communicates clearly and succinctly when animated, and a hands-on walk-through of how to turn a not-so-great static visualization into a great animated plot. The gganimate package will be the key tool discussed, and some familiarity with ggplot2 is recommended but not required.</p> <p>*****About the Speaker*****<br/>Stephanie Kirmer is a Senior Data Scientist at Journera, a company that helps the travel industry coordinate and manage customer data efficiently and securely, to improve traveler experiences.

Choose one or attend both!**</p> <p>Dr. Leah Welty will present: ""Collaborative Reproducibility: Connecting R/R Markdown and Microsoft Word using StatTag""</p> <p>Although R Markdown can render documents to Microsoft Word, R/R Markdown users must sometimes transcribe statistical content in to separate Microsoft Word documents (e.g., documents drafted by colleagues in Word, or documents that must be prepared in Word), a process that is error prone, irreproducible, and inefficient. We will present StatTag (www.stattag.org), an open source, free, and user-friendly program we developed to address this problem. StatTag establishes a bi-directional link between R/RMarkdown files and a Word document, and supports a reproducible pipeline even when: (1) statistical results must be included and updated in Word documents that were never generated from Markdown; and (2) text in Word files generated from R/RMarkdown has departed substantially from original Markdown content, for example through tracked changes or comments. We will demonstrate how to use StatTag to connect R/RMarkdown and Word files so that all files can be edited separately, but statistical content –values, tables, figures, and verbatim output– can be updated automatically in Word. Using practical examples, we will also illustrate how to use StatTag to view, edit, and rerun R/RMarkdown code directly from Word. The talk will also include an overview of reproducible research in the collaborative research.</p> <p>About the Speaker<br/>Leah J. Welty, PhD is Professor in the Division of Biostatistics, Department of Preventive Medicine and in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, and is the Director of the Biostatistics Collaboration Center within the Northwestern University Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute. She is also the Immediate Past President of the Association of Clinical and Translational Statisticians. She earned her PhD in statistics from the University of Chicago, and completed a postdoctoral fellowship in the Department of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health. Her research interests include longitudinal and multilevel models, psychiatric epidemiology, and the development of reproducible research tools for clinical and translational science. She is the lead biostatistician for the Northwestern Juvenile Project, a large-scale longitudinal study of psychiatric disorders and risky behaviors in delinquent youth. She has led the development of StatTag, a free, open-source program to support reproducible research in clinical and translational science.</p> <p>Schedule<br/>4:30-5pm - Food, Intros &amp; Announcements<br/>5-6pm - StatTag<br/>6-6:30pm - Socializing/Networking</p> <p>**This event is child-friendly!<br/>We realize this is an earlier start time than our normal events and strive to make it accessible to all.

Never fear: devtools is alive and well and remains the public face of this functionality, but it has recently been split into a handful of more focused packages, under the hood. Usethis now holds functionality related to package and project setup. I’ll explain the “conscious uncoupling” of devtools and describe the current features of usethis specifically. The DRY concept -- don’t repeat yourself -- is well accepted as a best practice for code and it’s an equally effective way to approach your development workflow. The usethis package offers functions that enact key steps of the package development process in a programmatic and documented way. This is an attractive alternative to doing everything by hand or, more realistically, copying and modifying files from one of your other packages. Usethis helps with initial setup and also with the sequential addition of features, such as specific dependencies (e.g. Rcpp, the pipe, the tidy eval toolkit) or practices (e.g. version control, testing, continuous integration).</p> <p>Agenda:</p> <p>6 - 6:30 pm : arrive + mingle<br/>6:30 pm : announcements + workshop starts<br/>8:00 pm : workshop ends</p> <p>Please RSVP on EventBrite: <a href=""https://www.eventbrite.com/o/rladies-vancouver-16633853582"" class=""linkified"">https://www.eventbrite.com/o/rladies-vancouver-16633853582</a></p> <p>A huge thanks to CodeCore for sponsoring the venue for this month's event.</p> <p>This is an R-Ladies event, please make sure that you adhere to our code of conduct: <a href=""https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct"" class=""linkified"">https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct</a></p> ","https://www.meetup.com/rladies-vancouver/events/262596788/"

While there are many incredible courses and resources, nothing is as effective as finding an intriguing question and challenging oneself to create an original visual answer. Generating visualizations can be astonishingly satisfying and can drive deep dives into R workflow, libraries, and community resources. I will present snippets of scripts and notebooks written to visually answer the following questions, running the gamut from quirky and light to serious and weighty: How often do female athletes grace the cover of Sports Illustrated? How have demographics changed in the sciences? How have Pixar movie ratings changed over time? How did US Senators vote on healthcare repeal? Which characters are closest on the TV show ‘Friends’?</p> <p>Presenter Bio:<br/>Alex Albright is a PhD student in economics at Harvard University. An aspiring labor and behavioral economist, Alex is passionate about making empirical academic work reproducible and accessible. Her usage of R stems from a desire to use tools that are freely available and open source.

Natural History Museums and Botanical Gardens have been digitizing their collections for over ten years yielding billions of data points culminating in one of the most exciting data resources the world has to offer. Evolutionary Biologist, Ciera Martinez, will be speaking about biodiversity data and her work as a current Mozilla Science Fellow. Her and her team have been working at the Berkeley Institute of Data Science exploring what the world of biodiversity data has to offer. You learn more about this project at curiositydata.org. In addition to talking about her biodiversity data project, she will speak about data science in academia and will host a brief workshop on how to use R to map fossils of extinct animals.</p> <p>Survival analysis (Mathilde):</p> <p>Data where value of a measurement or of an observation is partially known is defined as censored data. This type of data is very common in biomedical sciences, social sciences, engineering and ecology and particular care is required in their analysis. To deal with such data, survival analysis can be used.</p> <p>One of the main purposes of survival analysis is to estimate survival functions, i.e. the expected duration of time until one or more events happen, and their dependence on explanatory variables. In this presentation, we will see the caracteristics of this collection of statistical methods and their implementation in R, through the survival R package. Let's do survival analyses without suffering!</p> ","https://www.meetup.com/rladies-paris/events/261927062/"

As part of the initiative, R-Ladies Manchester will host a number of talks and workshops about the use of R. It doesn't matter if you never used R or if you are an R expert, R-Ladies Manchester welcomes anyone with an interest in R. The goal is to promote R, exchange knowledge and create an R community among women. We are fully inclusive and respectful of LGBT identities - our priority is to provide a safe community space for anyone identifying as female who is interested in and/or working with R.</p> <p>We will begin our first workshop by reinforcing the foundations of your data analysis knowledge and R skills, and then move on to creating reproducible reports using R Markdown. The workshop starts with some warm-ups to get your brain in R-mode, and to make sure the basics are covered. Through a series of demonstrations and hands on exercises, you will learn some of the fundamental concepts of R: basic use of the R/RStudio console, inputting and importing different data types, record keeping, graphs etc. It concludes by showing how to create reproducible R Markdown documents.

Sure, qualifications and experiences are vital pieces of the picture – hey with a background in software development, we’re well-versed in the importance of just the right skillset – but ultimately, placing the perfect candidate in the perfect job is also about personality, cultural fit and ambition.</p> <p>As such, we’re looking forward to placing people at the heart of every data science project we are involved in. From the people looking for just the right talent to help their team grow, to the people looking for the next digital role to get their teeth into, our approach will be relationship-led, face-to-face wherever possible, and packed with a healthy dose of Northern straight-talking. If you’re searching for the impossible, we’ll tell you. But if you’re just searching for the really, really hard-to-find – well, we’ll be able to help.”</p> <p>First gear!<br/>For our first event for a little while, we will be running an introduction to R presentation, covering things like installing R, loading up your first dataset and using your first packages, with hands on help to really get you moving.</p> <p>Revving up!<br/>Once we've whet your appetite, there'll be lightning talks from ladies who use R for some more advanced applications, to really inspire you to keep learning!

Come and join us to learn some common practices and procedures for data cleaning and exploration — how to get data into a ‘usable’ form and start looking at what they can tell you. We will touch on working with multiple datasets (joins) and strategies for when you need to learn more about your data or where they come from. This workshop is appropriate for all skill levels!</p> <p>There will be time for the group to skill-share and practice/troubleshoot; if you have new data that you are or will be working with this summer, bring it! Important to remember is that we are back at our home at the London Public Library Central Branch! We’ll be in the Stevenson and Hunt A Room - we’ll have signs! Parking is free if you park in the Citi Plaza lot - entrance on King. Bring your parking pass to the library’s main service desk and tell them you’re with R-Ladies to get your parking validated.</p> <p>London Public Library - Central 251 Dundas St London, Ontario Canada N6A 6H9</p> <p>After we’ve filled our heads with cleaning and exploration knowledge, we’ll explore our way right over to our favourite Milos’ for great beer and better company. See you all very soon!</p> ","https://www.meetup.com/rladies-ldnont/events/266728160/"

Moving from the formulas and a brief beer involved history of the t-test, we’ll go over a few applications in R using publicly available data sets.</p> <p>We meet again at ISET in room 5.2 from 7pm.</p> ","https://www.meetup.com/rladies-tbilisi/events/237753991/"

We will begin by basic operations on time series in R-studio.  Then by technical as well as by theoretical discussion we will go further and (1) we will analyze the basic types of stationary time series: autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) processes and (2) we will discuss Hodrick-prescott filter, by which we will show how we can separate trend and cyclical components of the time series. We will use R-studio. As practical side, mainly we will work on simulated data. The meet-up will be suitable also for beginners.</p> <p>We will need “mFilter” package to install.</p> <p>This meetup is hosted by Nino Melitauri and it will be held in Georgian.</p> ","https://www.meetup.com/rladies-tbilisi/events/241015901/"

The topic will be rmarkdown. We will begin by creating a new project, then using simple examples we will see how to build rmarkdown files in Rstudio. We will create a new notebook and see how it works. By using knit order we will produce a new word document and we will create a new presentation, showing conducted analysis in a convenient way. Also we will be able to have our output in PDF format, for this purpose you may need a Latex program (LaTeX installation link: <a href=""http://latex-project.org/ftp.html""><a href=""http://latex-project.org/ftp.html"" class=""linkified"">http://latex-project.org/ftp.html</a></a>).</p> <p>The meetup will be hosted by Nino Melitauri in Georgian.</p> ","https://www.meetup.com/rladies-tbilisi/events/243739439/"

This is suitable for beginners - it is a good continuation of the beginners' workshop this fall.</p> <p>During the session we solidify our knowledge of fundamental data structures in R and then learn efficient approaches of preparing data sets for analysis. First topic is very important for beginners: we must clearly understand how data are stored in R.<br/>Here we will discuss basic data types (vectors of logical, integer, numeric, character values) and more advanced types (lists and data frames). Also we will touch element indexing in R (e.g. why there are three ways to extract elements from a list: dollar sign, square brackets and double square brackets).</p> <p>Second part is useful to get more efficient and faster at data cleaning and preparation. It's a common problem for data scientists: we spend about 80% of our time moving cells, rows and columns around to get them ready for a specific analytical procedure. So to get more job done we must be efficient in data management. We will look at two modern R packages: dplyr and tidyr. They are like a Swiss Army knife for a data scientist, and we have low chances to survive in R community without them. These packages allow us to produce more elegant code that leads to faster development and reduces risk of errors. 30 minutes of Excel spreadsheet tasks can be completed with 3 lines of R code with these packages.</p> <p>The meetup will be hosted by Alexander Matrunich, in English.</p> <p>================================================</p>

We will introduce the main idea of it, how it works, and what is a decision tree. We will realize the advantages of the random forest, which are:<br/>- robustness to correlated predictors,<br/>- solving both regression and classification problems,<br/>- handling thousands of input variables without variable selection,<br/>- feature selection tool using its variable importance plot,<br/>- taking care of missing data internally in an effective manner.</p> <p>We will implement the method using customer churn example.</p> <p>The meetup will be hosted by Nino Melitauri, the working language will be Georgian.</p> ","https://www.meetup.com/rladies-tbilisi/events/249225943/"

Data wrangling gives the possibility to manipulate data, and make data visualization more flexible and give us possibility to do different operations on data.

She graduated as a mathematician and mostly learned programming on the job. She uses a lot of {shiny} and {data.table} and has experience in developing R packages for internal use. She finds it exciting to collaborate with people with different backgrounds.

Tamara es profesora en el MIT (EEUU) y trabaja en las áreas de aprendizaje automático y estadística. Su trabajo se basa en comprender cómo se puede cuantificar confiablemente la incertidumbre y la robustez en los procedimientos de análisis de datos modernos y complejos. Está particularmente interesada en inferencia bayesiana y modelos gráficos, con énfasis en el aprendizaje escalable, no paramétrico y no supervisado.</p> <p>Es una de las disertantes de la Machine Learning Summer School que tendrá lugar en Buenos Aires la semana del 18 de junio. Antes de sus charlas allí, nos visita en los meetups de R-Ladies y WiMLDS Buenos Aires. ¡¡Muchas gracias, Tamara!! ¡Es una alegría recibirte!</p> <p>La exposición será en inglés:</p> <p>Automated Scalable Bayesian Inference via Data Summarization</p> <p>Abstract: The use of Bayesian methods in large-scale data settings is attractive because of the rich hierarchical relationships, uncertainty quantification, and prior specification these methods provide. Many standard Bayesian inference algorithms are often computationally expensive, however, so their direct application to large datasets can be difficult or infeasible. Other standard algorithms sacrifice accuracy in the pursuit of scalability. We take a new approach. Namely, we leverage the insight that data often exhibit approximate redundancies to instead obtain a weighted subset of the data (called a ""coreset"") that is much smaller than the original dataset. We can then use this small coreset in existing Bayesian inference algorithms without modification. We provide theoretical guarantees on the size and approximation quality of the coreset. In particular, we show that our method provides geometric decay in posterior approximation error as a function of coreset size. We validate on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating that our method reduces posterior approximation error by orders of magnitude relative to uniform random subsampling.</p> <p>Si tenés ganas de ir leyendo sobre el tema, encontrás referencias aquí: <a href=""https://bit.ly/2snvPb4"" class=""linkified"">https://bit.ly/2snvPb4</a> y aquí: <a href=""https://bit.ly/2xwvoQA"" class=""linkified"">https://bit.ly/2xwvoQA</a>.</p> <p>¿Te parece que este meetup no es para vos?

Erin nos dará una charla sobre Scalable Automatic Machine Learning con H2O (en inglés). ¿De qué se trata esto?</p> <p>* H2O es una plataforma distribuida de aprendizaje automático de código abierto diseñada para big data. Los algoritmos principales de aprendizaje automático de H2O se implementan en Java de alto rendimiento, sin embargo, las API con todas las funciones están disponibles en R, Python, Scala, REST/JSON, y también a través de una interfaz web. Dado que las implementaciones de algoritmos de H2O se distribuyen, esto permite que el software escale a conjuntos de datos muy grandes -que superan la RAM en una sola máquina-. H2O actualmente presenta implementaciones distribuidas de modelos lineales generalizados, Gradient Boosting Machines, Random Forest, Deep Neural Nets, Stacked Ensembles (aka ""Super Learners""), métodos de reducción de dimensionalidad (PCA, GLRM), clusterización (K-means), detección de anomalías, etc.</p> <p>* H2O AutoML proporciona una interfaz fácil de usar que automatiza el pre-procesamiento de datos, el entrenamiento y el ajuste de una gran selección de modelos candidatos (incluidos múltiples modelos de conjuntos apilados para un rendimiento superior) y, debido a la naturaleza distribuida de la plataforma de H2O, H2O AutoML puede escalar a conjuntos de datos muy grandes. El resultado de la ejecución de H2O AutoML es una ""tabla de clasificación"" de modelos fácilmente exportable para su uso en producción. Ejemplos de código en R y en Python estarán disponibles en GitHub para que les participantes puedan seguirlos en sus laptops (de todos modos, no es necesario que traigas tu laptop!).</p> <p>A lo largo de la charla, entonces, contarás con una breve descripción del campo del aprendizaje automático, seguida de una mirada detallada dentro del algoritmo AutoML de H2O.</p> <p>¿Te parece que este meetup no es para vos? Creemos que es una oportunidad única para conocer e interactuar con una de las mejores investigadoras de su disciplina en un ambiente relajado, amigable e inclusivo.</p> <p>¿El inglés te saca las ganas? Si querés hacerle alguna pregunta a Erin las organizadoras podemos ayudar.</p> <p>¡Ojalá te sumes! Además de la charla de Erin, vas a podér conocer más sobre R-Ladies y WiMLDS. También habrá tiempo para hacer sociales y nuevas conexiones.</p> <p>Nuestro compromiso: te vas a sentir muy bien y le vamos a poner la buena onda de siempre.</p> <p>En esta ocasión nos recibe generosamente Telecom quien también nos ofrecerá un rico catering acorde con esta ocasión tan especial.</p> <p>¡Nos vemos!</p> ","https://www.meetup.com/rladies-buenos-aires/events/265091531/"

Many standard Bayesian inference algorithms are often computationally expensive, however, so their direct application to large datasets can be difficult or infeasible. We show that our method provides geometric decay in posterior approximation error as a function of coreset size. We validate on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating that our method reduces posterior approximation error by orders of magnitude relative to uniform random subsampling.</p> <p>Si tenés ganas de ir leyendo sobre el tema, encontrás referencias aquí: <a href=""https://bit.ly/2snvPb4"" class=""linkified"">https://bit.ly/2snvPb4</a> y aquí: <a href=""https://bit.ly/2xwvoQA"" class=""linkified"">https://bit.ly/2xwvoQA</a>.</p> ","https://www.meetup.com/rladies-santa-fe/events/251640917/"

Repaso de los conceptos filosóficos que diferencian al Software Libre. Las cuatro libertades del usuario. Qué implica esto para R y para aquellas personas que decidan usarlo. La Cultura Libre y cómo ser parte de una comunidad que no para de crecer.</p> <p>&gt; ""RMarkdown : Cómo hacer que tus análisis sean reproducibles"". R Markdown permite escribir informes reproducibles y dinámicos con R. En un archivo con formato R Markdown podés escribir texto y a mismo tiempo incluir código de R que se ejecutan y muestran los resultados para crear presentaciones, documentos pdf, html, Word y otros. Este taller está pensado para quienes tienen un nivel básico, así que no te preocupes si recién empezás a codear en R. Si ya tenés experiencia con R pero no sabés usar R Markdown también podés venir y te ayudamos a convertir tu script en un informe reproducible.</p> <p>:: CRONOGRAMA ::<br/>&gt; 16:30hs a 17:00hs - Recepción y organización.

Estudios recientes muestran que la diversidad de insectos ejerce una polinización más eficaz que la producida por pocas especies. En el marco de la Resolución Provincial N° 136 que prohíbe el uso de banquinas con fines agrícola se propuso conocer la diversidad de los potenciales polinizadores y su interacción con las flores en márgenes de rutas y caminos no cultivados.

El análisis de los sistemas ecológicos como redes ha desempeñado un papel central en el desarrollo de la ecología como ciencia. Las redes se pueden agrupar en tres clases, en función de los tipos de organismos e interacciones involucradas: redes tróficas, redes hospedero-parasitoide y redes mutualistas. Las redes mutualistas comprenden las interacciones que son beneficiosas para ambas partes (por ejemplo, redes planta-polinizador y planta-dispersor). Las interacciones han tenido un papel central en la evolución de la biodiversidad terrestre y son el sostén de la diversidad y el funcionamiento de las comunidades naturales.<br/>En los últimos años estás herramientas han pasado de ser investigación pura a investigación aplicada, por ejemplo, se han aplicado en el contexto de la restauración del hábitats, el estudio de invasiones de especies exóticas, el manejo del pastoreo, el control biológico de plagas, la conservación de especies, entre muchas otras.</p> <p>:: PÚBLICO ::<br/>El espacio es limitado, por lo que les agradecemos su comprensión.

No entanto, ao longo dos anos, muitos recursos e pacotes foram adicionados, oferecendo aos usuários mais ferramentas para criar ambientes inteiros. Um exemplo disso é o pacote Shiny: um framework para construir aplicações web usando o R. As aplicações Shiny são uma forma poderosa e fácil de compartilhar e comunicar sua análise e permitir que as pessoas interajam com ela. Na In Loco, temos uma série de aplicações construídas usando tal framework, tanto para clientes externos quanto internos. Nessa palestra vamos compartilhar os desafios e soluções aplicadas durante o desenvolvimento.</p> <p>*Bio do Palestrante<br/>Gabriel Teotonio é graduando em Estatística da UFPE e cientista de dados na In Loco (Location Intelligence). Atualmente trabalha com localização de dados para campanhas de mídia Out of Home, desenvolvendo classificações, algoritmos estatísticos e aplicações em Shiny para os produtos de dados. Interesses de pesquisa incluem: modelos de regressão, métodos de ordem superior para estatística inferencial e análise estatística de formas</p> <p>_____________________________________________<br/>Sobre o CONRE-3</p> <p>* O grupo ""C3 Estatística e Ciência de Dados"" é uma iniciativa promovida pelo Conselho Regional de Estatística da 3ª Região (CONRE-3), buscando estimular a discussão sobre aplicações da análise de dados nos mais diversos contextos e áreas do conhecimento. Se você tem o espírito curioso e a mente aberta para descobrir como uma boa análise pode revelar padrões que desafiam o senso comum, venha trocar uma ideia com a gente! Aqui você vai encontrar uma galera que entende quanto tempo leva para arrumar o banco de dados, deixar aquele gráfico cheio de estilo, selecionar o modelo mais adequado... #tamojunto :-)</p> <p>Saiba mais em:<br/><a href=""https://www.meetup.com/C3-Estatistica-e-Ciencia-de-dados/"" class=""linkified"">https://www.meetup.com/C3-Estatistica-e-Ciencia-de-dados/</a></p> <p>_____________________________________________<br/>Sobre as R-Ladies</p> <p>* R-Ladies é uma organização que promove a diversidade de gênero na comunidade da linguagem R.

Proporciona herramientas sencillas para las tareas de manipulación de datos más comunes. Está diseñado para trabajar directamente con marcos de datos, con muchas tareas comunes optimizadas al estar escritas en un lenguaje compilado (C ++). Una característica adicional es la capacidad de trabajar directamente con datos almacenados en una base de datos externa. Los beneficios de hacer esto son que los datos se pueden gestionar de forma nativa en una base de datos relacional, las consultas se pueden realizar en esa base de datos y solo se devuelven los resultados de la consulta. Esto resuelve un problema común con R en que todas las operaciones se llevan a cabo en la memoria y, por lo tanto, la cantidad de datos con la que puede trabajar está limitada por la memoria disponible. Las conexiones de la base de datos esencialmente eliminan esa limitación, ya que puede conectarse a una base de datos de muchos cientos de GB, realizar consultas directamente sobre ella y volver a incluir en R solo lo que necesita para el análisis.<br/>¡Las esperamos! <U+0001F49C></p> <p>• Lo que hay que traer<br/>Computadora con R Studio instalado.</p> ","https://www.meetup.com/rladies-san-jose/events/dbnnkpycclbfb/"

In recent years she has mainly focused on R as a tool to produce beautiful (and informative!) data visualisations.</p> <p>Replace Venn diagrams with UpSetR<br/>One of the common issues in data analysis is to efficiently represent overlap between various classes of objects. The most widespread tool for the task, Venn diagrams, often have poor informative value or are hard to interpret. In this talk, Chiara will introduce UpSetR, originally developed for the analysis of genomic datasets, that provides a great alternative to Venn diagrams.</p> <p>Marian Keane, Senior Consultant Analyst at Presidion, Version 1 Company<br/>Marian works with public and commercial organisations to leverage the power of data in order to realise business goals.

De ce constat est née la médecine personalisée, ou médecine de précision, qui vise à aussi adapter la stratégie thérapeutique aux spécificités des patients. Or ces différences entre patients<br/>s'expliquent en partie par des différences génomiques. Mettre en œuvre<br/>la médecine de précision requiert donc d'identifier, dans des jeux de<br/>données génomiques, les variables associées à la présence d'une maladie, à son évolution, ou à une réponse thérapeutique.</p> <p>Cependant, ces jeux de données comportent fréquemment largement plus de variables (pouvant aller jusqu'à la dizaine de millions) que<br/>d'échantillons (plus classiquement de l'ordre de quelques milliers), ce<br/>qui pose des problèmes tant calculatoires que statistiques.</p> <p>Dans cet exposé, je présenterai comment utiliser des connaissances a<br/>priori sur la structure des variables, qu'il s'agisse de contraindre la<br/>sélection de variables grâce à des réseaux biologiques, ou pour tenir<br/>compte des corrélations entre régions du génome, pour répondre à ces<br/>difficultés.</p> <p>Chloé-Agathe Azencott est chercheur au Centre for Computational Biology (CBIO) de Mines ParisTech, Institut Curie and INSERM.

While this system has advanced the analytical strength of reporting, there are also challenges with using R for old school, PDF-style, reports. These challenges, and some upcoming improvements will be explored during this talk.</p> <p>- Random Problems with R (by Kellie Ottoboni)<br/>As part of my dissertation, I dug into the pseudo-random number generators and sampling algorithms used by common statistical pkgs. Along the way, I found an issue with the way R generates pseudo-random integers using the sample() function. I'll give an example where we'd like to generate integers uniformly on an interval, but sample produces 2x as many odd numbers as even ones.</p> <p>- Teaching visualization and ggplot2 (by Sara Altman)<br/>Most data visualization resources focus either on the mechanics of a particular visualization tool or on the craft of creating effective visualizations. I’ll talk about teaching both—the mechanics and the craft—simultaneously. I’ll also discuss some ideas for improving your own visualizations.</p> <p>- Programming with dplyr: Quasiquotation and Quosures (by Ankur Bhatia)<br/>Because most dplyr function use Nonstandard Evaluation, they don't follow the normal rules of R evaluation. This makes the goal of passing reference objects within dplyr code non-straightforward. However, through quasiquotation and quosures, R allows us to write reliable functions that incorporate dplyr verbs.</p> <p>Speakers:</p> <p>- Diya is a biology postdoc at UC Berkeley and a fellow at the BIDS.

Leveraging language data in healthcare (by Robyn Ball)<br/>—<br/>Many critical questions in healthcare can only be answered by combining structured and unstructured data. Language data is the most rich and high-valued data in healthcare, yet it often is underutilized due to the complexity of developing natural language models that can extract meaningful insights. I will provide a brief overview of using NLP in the healthcare, describe Roam's general framework, and provide datasets and other resources that can be used to jump-start research projects.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Dr. Robyn Ball is a Clinical Data Scientist at Roam Analytics, where she leverages Roam’s data and machine learning assets to create analyses of patient pathways through disease and treatment progression. Dr. Ball earned her Ph.D. in Statistics from Texas A&amp;M University. She has conducted biomedical research as a NASA fellow and as an intern at UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, developed novel computational methods for genomic data at The Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine, and was most recently a Senior Biostatistician at Stanford University where she collaborated with medical researchers on studies that posed methodological challenges.</p> <p>2. Functions, Packages and Visualization in R: a case study using 'cholera' (by Peter Li)<br/>—<br/>John Snow's map of the 1854 cholera outbreak in London's Soho is a classic example of data visualization. For Snow, the map served as support of his two then contested, if not controversial claims: that cholera is a waterborne disease and that the water pump on Broad Street was the source of the outbreak.<br/>To evaluate whether the map does or can support such claims, I've been developing the R 'cholera' package (CRAN and GitHub).

Building clinical trial machine learning software in R.<br/>—<br/>Many people think you can't use R to build production software, particularly when that software uses adaptive machine learning to process millions of data points, and those data are from patients on live pharmaceutical clinical trials studying new drugs for FDA approval. I'll explain the machine learning methods and R programming approach to solve this problem.</p> <p>Bio: Mike Elashoff is Head of Data Science at Project Ronin, a start-up using personalized predictive models to improve treatment outcomes for cancer patients. He was previously a statistical reviewer at the FDA, and co-founded a software company that developed novel machine learning / AI methods for clinical trials (acquired by Medidata Solutions in 2014). He received a PhD in Biostatistics from Harvard University.</p> <p>2. Combining similar data from different sources<br/>—<br/>The dirty little secret of data science is that we often spend much more time preparing the data for analysis than doing the analysis itself, and may even ignore data because it is too time consuming to add to what we have. Often we can find multiple sources with complementary information that need to be standardized to be used together (e.g. air pollution data reported by each state agency). I will share the packages, workflow, and philosophical insights that allowed us to standardize clinical trial data in an efficient, reproducible, and scalable way, and will hopefully help you create more complete datasets for your projects.</p> <p>Bio: Clara Oromendia is a Biostatistician at Project Ronin, a start-up using personalized predictive models to improve treatment outcomes for cancer patients. She believes it is our duty as data scientists to add context to data and transform numbers into actionable conclusions in a scientifically sound way.

Sadly a fact of human nature is that once you’re comfortable doing something a certain way, it’s hard to find the motivation to learn a different way of doing something that you already know how to do. While the tidyverse is primarily made up of a set of super useful R packages (ggplot2, dplyr, purrr, tidyr, readr, tibble), it is also a way of thinking about implementing “tidy” data analysis. If you combine tidy thinking with the tidy packages, you will inevitably become a master of tidy analysis. This talk will provide a guide for easing into the tidyverse for new users by first focusing on piping, dplyr, and ggplot2, and then providing short summaries and references for the remaining packages that form the tidyverse (and how they play together). Additional resources for continuing your tidyverse journey will be provided.</p> <p>• Target audience:<br/>People familiar with base R who want to familiarize themselves with the tidyverse, as well as those who have a little experience with the tidyverse and want a big picture of how it all fits together.</p> <p>The talk will be a combination of slides and live-coding, and is based on my two-part blog post on the tidyverse: <a href=""http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2019-08-05_base_r_to_tidyverse/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2019-08-05_base_r_to_tidyverse/</a> and <a href=""http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2019-08-05_base_r_to_tidyverse_pt2/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2019-08-05_base_r_to_tidyverse_pt2/</a></p> <p>• Bio:<br/>Rebecca is a Statistics PhD Student at UC Berkeley as well as a Data Science Fellow at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS). Her dual passions are explaining “seemingly complicated” concepts to others in plain English, and exploring and presenting the stories that underlie complex datasets. She has dabbled in writing software as the author of the superheat R package for creating beautiful and customizable heatmaps in R. Rebecca also writes blog posts about R and statistics over at her website, www.rebeccabarter.com.

By 1974, the British computer industry was all but extinct. What happened in the intervening thirty years holds lessons for all postindustrial superpowers. As Britain struggled to use technology to retain its global power, the nation's inability to manage its technical labor force hobbled its transition into the information age.</p> <p>In Programmed Inequality, Marie Hicks explores the story of labor feminization and gendered technocracy that undercut British efforts to computerize. That failure sprang from the government's systematic neglect of its largest trained technical workforce simply because they were women. Women were a hidden engine of growth in high technology from World War II to the 1960s. As computing experienced a gender flip, becoming male-identified in the 1960s and 1970s, labor problems grew into structural ones and gender discrimination caused the nation's largest computer user<U+2015>the civil service and sprawling public sector<U+2015>to make decisions that were disastrous for the British computer industry and the nation as a whole.</p> <p>Drawing on recently opened government files, personal interviews, and the archives of major British computer companies, Programmed Inequality takes aim at the fiction of technological meritocracy.Hicks explains why, even today, possessing technical skill is not enough to ensure that women will rise to the top in science and technology fields. Programmed Inequality shows how the disappearance of women from the field had grave macroeconomic consequences for Britain, and why the United States risks repeating those errors in the twenty-first century.</p> ","https://www.meetup.com/rladies-dc/events/256284759/"

To its adherents, it is an elegant statement about learning from experience. To its opponents, it is subjectivity run amok.</p> <p>In the first-ever account of Bayes' rule for general readers, Sharon Bertsch McGrayne explores this controversial theorem and the human obsessions surrounding it. She traces its discovery by an amateur mathematician in the 1740s through its development into roughly its modern form by French scientist Pierre Simon Laplace. She reveals why respected statisticians rendered it professionally taboo for 150 years—at the same time that practitioners relied on it to solve crises involving great uncertainty and scanty information (Alan Turing's role in breaking Germany's Enigma code during World War II), and explains how the advent of off-the-shelf computer technology in the 1980s proved to be a game-changer. Today, Bayes' rule is used everywhere from DNA de-coding to Homeland Security.</p> <p>Drawing on primary source material and interviews with statisticians and other scientists, The Theory That Would Not Die is the riveting account of how a seemingly simple theorem ignited one of the greatest controversies of all time.</p> ","https://www.meetup.com/rladies-dc/events/257728007/"

If you didn't care how your life looked on Instagram, or worry about what total strangers thought of you. Imagine if you could let go of the guilt, and stop beating yourself up for tiny mistakes. What if, in every decision you faced, you took the bolder path?</p> <p>Too many of us feel crushed under the weight of our own expectations. We run ourselves ragged trying to please everyone, all the time. We lose sleep ruminating about whether we may have offended someone, pass up opportunities that take us out of our comfort zones, and avoid rejection at all costs.</p> <p>There's a reason we act this way, Reshma says. As girls, we were taught to play it safe. Well-meaning parents and teachers praised us for being quiet and polite, urged us to be careful so we didn't get hurt, and steered us to activities at which we could shine.</p> <p>The problem is that perfect girls grow up to be women who are afraid to fail. It's time to stop letting our fears drown out our dreams and narrow our world, along with our chance at happiness.</p> <p>By choosing bravery over perfection, we can find the power to claim our voice, to leave behind what makes us unhappy, and go for the things we genuinely, passionately want. Perfection may set us on a path that feels safe, but bravery leads us to the one we're authentically meant to follow.</p> <p>In Brave, Not Perfect, Reshma shares powerful insights and practices to help us override our perfect girl training and make bravery a lifelong habit. By being brave, not perfect, we can all become the authors of our biggest, boldest, and most joyful life.</p> <p>PS Please contact the organizer if you lack the funds to purchase the book.</p> ","https://www.meetup.com/rladies-dc/events/258830130/"

And why is it so hard for competent people--especially competent women--to advance?</p> <p>Marshaling decades of rigorous research, Chamorro-Premuzic points out that although men make up a majority of leaders, they underperform when compared with female leaders. In fact, most organizations equate leadership potential with a handful of destructive personality traits, like overconfidence and narcissism. In other words, these traits may help someone get selected for a leadership role, but they backfire once the person has the job.</p> <p>When competent women--and men who don't fit the stereotype--are unfairly overlooked, we all suffer the consequences. The result is a deeply flawed system that rewards arrogance rather than humility, and loudness rather than wisdom.</p> <p>There is a better way. With clarity and verve, Chamorro-Premuzic shows us what it really takes to lead and how new systems and processes can help us put the right people in charge.</p> <p>PS Please contact the organizer if you lack the funds to purchase the book.</p> ","https://www.meetup.com/rladies-dc/events/260727694/"

Her first book is a revelatory treatise on plant life—but it is also so much more.</p> <p>Lab Girl is a book about work, love, and the mountains that can be moved when those two things come together. It is told through Jahren’s stories: about her childhood in rural Minnesota with an uncompromising mother and a father who encouraged hours of play in his classroom’s labs; about how she found a sanctuary in science, and learned to perform lab work done “with both the heart and the hands”; and about the inevitable disappointments, but also the triumphs and exhilarating discoveries, of scientific work.</p> <p>Yet at the core of this book is the story of a relationship Jahren forged with a brilliant, wounded man named Bill, who becomes her lab partner and best friend. Their sometimes rogue adventures in science take them from the Midwest across the United States and back again, over the Atlantic to the ever-light skies of the North Pole and to tropical Hawaii, where she and her lab currently make their home.</p> <p>PS Please contact the organizer if you need support finding the book.</p> ","https://www.meetup.com/rladies-dc/events/263693034/"

It’s very common to get data from databases, csv files, Excel files, APIs, or from websites through HTML tables. One less common but tricky way to get data is from PDFs. PDFs come in 2 forms - machine readable and non-machine readable. Dr. Stephanie Zimmer will give examples of both and discuss some tricks and tips she's learned to get these data into R so they can be analyzed. The bulk of the work will be done by two packages: pdftools and tesseract. We will also use the tidyverse package to parse data once it's in R.</p> <p>What's the schedule?<br/>6:00pm - 6:15pm - Networking<br/>6:15pm - 6:35pm - Lightning Talks* (Karen Jin et al. &amp; Margaret Reed et al.)<br/>6:35pm - 6:45pm - Set up (install R packages, etc.)<br/>6:45pm - 7:45pm - Workshop<br/>7:45pm - 8:00pm - Wrap up</p> <p>*We are looking for Lightning Talk presenters!

In questo workshop dimostriamo come la qualità dei dati può essere sistematicamente definita e migliorata utilizzando R. Il workshop si concentra sulla convalida dei dati (controllo dei dati), individua gli errori e imputa valori mancanti o errati sotto restrizioni. Presentiamo brevi introduzioni ai principi principali, forniamo quiz e discussioni per il pubblico e forniamo brevi esercizi basati su R. Dimostreremo alcuni dei nostri pacchetti R, tra cui ""validate"" (per i controlli di qualità dei dati) ""errorlocate"" (per localizzazione degli errori), ""simputation"" per i metodi di imputaton e ""lumberjack"" (per tenere traccia delle modifiche nei dati). Sarà prestata particolare attenzione a come combinare le varie fasi dell'elaborazione dei dati e come analizzare e visualizzare i risultati.

Lo scopo dell’organizzazione è di promuovere diversità ed equità di genere nella comunità di utenti di R.</p> <p>Se utilizzi, o vorresti imparare ad utilizzare R, questo è il gruppo giusto! Tutti sono benvenuti gratuitamente, previa registrazione a , ed hanno la possibilità di imparare in un contesto amicale e di supporto. Ci sono anche occasioni di mentorship per condividere le proprie conoscenze come speakers. Queste opportunità sono preferenzialmente rivolte a donne e minoranze.</p> <p>Il prossimo evento<br/>Cosa imparerai?<br/>Attraverso una breve introduzione ai sistemi di version control, come Git e GitHub, imparerai come utilizzare questi strumenti per rendere il tuo lavoro più efficiente ed evitare errori che potrebbero costarti giornate intere di programmazione. NB: questi sistemi non si limitano al mondo di R ma sono diffusissimi tra programmatori e data scientists che utilizzano i più svariati linguaggi di programmazione.</p> <p>A seguire, parleremo di RMarkdown, un formato di file che permette di creare reports in Word|PDF|HTML contenente sia testo scritto (i.e., plain text) che codice di programmazione. Questo è estremamente utile quando devi condividere il tuo lavoro con altri colleghi o supervisori. Imparerai a utilizzare RMarkdown attraverso una session pratica per capire le potenzialità di questo formato e vedere come creare reports personalizzati per le tue esigenze.</p> <p>Negli ultimi 30 minuti faremo networking per conoscerci meglio.

For the meetup of the month, we will have a workshop on how to use RMarkdown ""How to communicate your results with Rmarkdown &amp; knitr"".<br/>Our amazing speaker this time is ""Otho Mantegazza"".<br/>Otho is going to show us how to communicate &amp; present final results in an engaged way to our audience.<br/>Our audience can be our team, non-techinical people or even creating an archive for ourselves just remember what were doing in six months from now.<br/>Enabling this R has two powerful packages to utilize: markdown and knitr. These two packages are helping us to knit together R code &amp; markdown text together super easy.<br/>These packages run R code, style text and show the results in a single output. In this way we can produce elegant and reproducible reports.<br/>Since markdown is native to HTML, its integration in R works best with html outputs, in addition we can use other packages to produce other HTML outputs such as slides, books or a blog.<br/>In this workshop Otho will show us how to use those tools and what we can achieve with them, with practical exercises and examples from his work in the field of biology and genomics.<br/>Level: beginner<br/>Be sure that you have installed the packages Rmarkdown and knitr.<br/>install.packages(c(""rmarkdown"", ""knitr""))<br/>Additional packages that you might want to try:<br/>install.packages(c(""revealjs"",""bookdown"",""blogdown"",""leaflet"",""r2d3""))<br/>Please find more info in his github: <a href=""https://github.com/othomantegazza/talk-rladies"" class=""linkified"">https://github.com/othomantegazza/talk-rladies</a><br/>Otho, is a biologist &amp; a freelancer data scientist. He did his last Postdoc at IRD (Institut de Recherche pour le Développement) and his Phd in Biology @ university of Milan. He has learned R during his PhD while producing extensive datasets in his research as he wanted to analyze them autonomously. Later, R has been fundamental in his two postdocs, where he used it on a daily basis to explore and model genomic data. First at HHU/CEPLAS, in Duesseldorf, where he used it to find targets to improve photosynthesis in crops, later at IRD, in Montpellier, where he used it to explore the genetics of Asian and African rice.</p> ","https://www.meetup.com/rladies-milan/events/260831732/"

About the talk: In oncology, progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the time to detection of disease progression or death, and is commonly captured in clinical trials as an endpoint to evaluate treatment efficacy. In trial settings, progression is assessed at regular intervals. In contrast, progression from electronic health record (EHR) data is collected at variable intervals when patients see their oncologist. Therefore, to better understand how sensitive EHR-derived real world progression variable is to treatment effects, we have designed a set of simulations of progression in both the clinical trial and EHR settings at Flatiron Health. We simulate two major sources of error (variable progression assessments and error from extracting data from the EHR), and measure the impact of these errors on our ability to detect a known treatment effect. To speed the run time of these simulations, we use the foreach package. The foreach package provides a new looping construct for executing R code repeatedly which supports parallel execution. In this talk I will give an overview of the simulations with a focus on the use of the foreach package for parallelization.</p> <p>Following Elizabeth is Mine Dogucu, founder of both R Ladies Columbus and R Ladies Sarasota, who will introduce missing data terminology and ways of handling missing data using R. Details: It is common for data scientists and researchers to encounter missing data. The term “missing” often has a bad connotation and is usually considered a nuisance. Advances in missing data treatments such as multiple imputation and maximum likelihood procedures allow data analysts to obtain unbiased parameter estimates under certain circumstances.</p> <p>About the speakers:</p> <p>Elizabeth Sweeney is a senior quantitative scientist at Flatiron Health where she works on the analysis of electronic health record (EHR) data in oncology. Previously she was a Rice Academy Postdoctoral Fellow in the Statistics department at Rice University. She did her PhD on methods for neuroimaging analysis in the Department of Biostatistics at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health with Ciprian Crainiceanu and Taki Shinohara. She is an avid R user and co-taught a course of neuroimaging analysis in R on Coursera called Neurohacking in R.</p> <p>Mine Dogucu completed her PhD at the Ohio State University. During her graduate studies she founded R Ladies Columbus. In August 2017, she joined the Data Science Program at New College of Florida as Assistant Professor of Applied Statistics. She has been teaching statistics courses both at the undergraduate and graduate levels. She also has founded R Ladies Sarasota.</p> ","https://www.meetup.com/rladies-newyork/events/247926543/"

The noisy interface between these can be an impediment to reproducibility, as well as a royal pain. I will discuss approaches I and others have tried in dealing with these issues, and why and how some have failed and succeeded.

Bridging the gaps between parties can be a perilous journey. In this talk, I will discuss how I have attempted to navigate this tricky terrain and provide some pointers for clear language use and data visualization choices.

Changing priorities can lead to significant revisions of the code and reports at multiple points. While the nature of these changes may be unpredictable, the amount of labor required to implement them can be greatly reduced by utilizing flexible programming designs. In R, the get() and eval() functions enable a dynamic and more robust approach to working with data. In functions, reports, and interactive applications, the get() and eval() methods can simplify the manner in which software is designed across many variables, values, or structures. When this paradigm is fully implemented, many changes -- such as the name of a variable or the selection of which factors to analyze -- can be implemented with minimal revision, sometimes in a single line of code. Such a paradigm enables significant improvements in the reproducibility, reusability, and adaptability of a program. With these designs, the productivity of a data scientist can greatly increase. In this talk, I will provide a number of examples that demonstrate the usage of get() and eval() in building reports and shiny applications and discuss the impact it has on my work in multiple industries.</p> <p>Bio: David Shilane is a data scientist with broad experience working in both academic and industrial settings. He serves on the faculty of Columbia University's Applied Analytics program, teaching courses in machine learning, data science, and statistical methods. David is also the founder of the data science firm Lambency. In this role, he has developed organizational data science initiatives and analytical infrastructures from the ground up in partnership with a number of companies and start-ups. Devising novel applications and analytical systems in the R programming language forms an integral part of this work. David is excited to convey these experiences -- about the statistical methods, technical implementations, and new discoveries derived from data -- to drive new understanding and ventures, both in and outside of the classroom. He has conducted research in areas of medicine, health economics, public health, machine learning methods, educational technology, and statistical software. He received degrees from Stanford University and the University of California Berkeley.</p> <p>Title: Integrating R with Tableau</p> <p>Abstract: Tasked with a semester-long project for a Data Science Translation class, Madison wanted to create compelling visualizations that would appeal to any audience.

When we have access to dynamic, longitudinal, continuously updating data, that complexity can become an asset. We will demonstrate how to to simplify data quality monitoring of dynamic data with a functional programming approach that enables early and actionable detection of data quality concerns. Using `purrr` as well as `tidyr` and nested tibbles, we will illustrate the five key pillars of enjoyable, user-friendly data quality monitoring with relevant R code: Readability, Reproducibility, Efficiency, Robustness, and Compositionality.</p> <p>Speaker 1: Jacqueline Gutman is a data scientist on the Quantitative Sciences team at Flatiron Health, supporting cancer research and improving patient care by working with electronic health record data and building accessible data science tools for reproducible research.</p> <p>Talk 2: Survival analysis for everyone!<br/>When people initially think of survival analysis, they usually think of terminal diseases and mortality. But it had much broader applications in the medical field. I'll be giving a brief overview of survival analysis, it's applications in a behavioral health managed care setting, and some tips on communicating these results to clinical teams.</p> <p>Speaker 2: Jessica Streeter is a Data Scientist at Spring Health, and a medical sociologist turned data scientist. She has spent her career working in the behavioral health space, including in direct care at an inpatient psychiatrist hospital.</p> <p>Talk 3: Hierarchical Models for Survival Analysis with Spatial Risk Factors in R<br/>Observations within a community are more likely to be correlated than those from different communities. Hierarchical models with random effects are often built to account for such correlation. In this talk, I will focus on spatial hierarchical models in the context of survival data. I will review survival model with random frailties, to account for clustering within a community, and its extension to account for autocorrelation between frailties of neighboring communities.</p> <p>Speaker 3: Sam Adhikari an assistant professor of Biostatistics in the Department of Population Health, NYU School of Medicine. Her research interest lies in developing and implementing statistical and machine learning tools to solve problems motivated by real world applications in medicine, global health and education.</p> ","https://www.meetup.com/rladies-newyork/events/266165183/"

The term “missing” often has a bad connotation and is usually considered a nuisance. Advances in missing data treatments such as multiple imputation and maximum likelihood procedures allow data analysts to obtain unbiased parameter estimates under certain circumstances.

An insurance policy is a promise by the insurer to the policyholder to pay for future claims for an upfront received premium. As a result insurers don’t know the upfront cost for their service, but rely on historical data analysis and judgement to predict a sustainable price for their offering. This talk will give a brief overview of some techniques how risks can be modelled in R.</p> <p>-----</p> <p>Emilia Kalarus, reserving and capital modelling actuary.  Last five years she spent in London helping clients in their preparations towards Solvency II. Her team built the internal capital model and advised client during the internal model pre-application process. The whole model parameterisation was performed in R. Currently she works for Triple A – Risk Finance being responsible for GI insurance projects.</p> <p>Presentation: Non-life insurance in R</p> <p>The R statistical system is a very powerful tool in Non-life actuarial analysis. Presentation will cover topics related to reserving, capital and extreme loss modelling.

Glówna czesc wystapienia zostanie poprzedzona prezentacja historii i zadan Departamentu.R jest doskonalym narzedziem do eksploracji danych, analiz, modelowania. W polaczeniu z markdownem czy shiny daje tez mozliwosci przygotowania odtwarzalnych raportów i interaktywnych aplikacji. W tej czesci prezentacji opowiemy o ewolucji narzedzi wykorzystywanych do prowadzenia analiz w Departamentu. Opiszemy, jak na przestrzeni czasu zmienil sie model pracy – od niezawodnej pary Excel (w tym VBA) + Word, az po system bedacy w stanie skladac tysiacstronicowe dokumenty. Opowiemy o problemach na jakie natrafilismy próbujac wdrozyc Ra jako narzedzie wspólnej pracy nad duzym projektem i przedstawimy rozwiazania jakie przyjelismy (tworzac zupelnie nowe problemy). W jaki sposób przygotowac narzedzia do jednoczesnej pracy wielu osób, jak uniknac problemów pt. „dziwne, u mnie dziala”, dlaczego nie uzyc po prostu Rmarkdown, co dalej – pokazemy, jak odpowiedzielismy na te i inne pytania. Na koniec opiszemy zarys TOPURa – pakietu do definiowania i konstruowania raportów z „klocków”.W opracowywanych przez Departament dokumentach, wykorzystywane sa metody z szeroko pojetej analizy ilosciowej i procesu wspomagania decyzji. W tej czesci wystapienia, zostanie zaprezentowany model oparty na metodzie wyborów preferencyjnych z nieznana liczba zwyciezców, wykorzystany do wskazywania osrodków ginekologiczno-polozniczych, wykazujacych  potencjal na wykonanie przynajmniej 400 porodów w przyszlosci.

We decided to choose assertr from many possible packages which outperforms other tools with provided features. I will discuss most of them in my presentation.</p> <p>During the analysis, we learn more about data and related problems. Well-run communication concerning state of the data can result with improvement of data collection processes, its condition, and allow us to continue our work with better results. Nevertheless, it is common for analyses to be carried out in a language incomprehensible to business. I will show you how we solved this problem through minor improvements of assertr, and usage of shiny.semantic package to generate clear and elegant, yet understandable for business reports.</p> <p>BIOs:<br/>Patrícia Martinková is a researcher and vice-head at Department of Statistical Modelling, Institute of Computer Science of the Czech Academy of Sciences.

This is straightforward due to the notion of ordering of a univariate sample, which can readily reveal possible outliers. In the bivariate case, however, it is often difficult to detect extreme points and verify whether a sample of residuals is a reasonable realisation from a fitted model. We propose a new framework, implemented as the bivrp R package, available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network. Our framework uses the same principles of the simulation envelope in a half-normal plot, but as a simulation polygon for each point in a bivariate sample. By using algorithms of convex hull construction and polygon area reduction, we describe how our method works and illustrate its functionality with examples using simulated bivariate normal data and real bivariate count data on animal ecology. We show how different model diagnostics can produce different results and pinpoint potential drawbacks of our approach, such as the limitations in terms of computational burden and convex hull bias.</p> <p>Filip Cyprowski</p> <p>Bio</p> <p>Od 8 lat zwiazany z analiza danych i tworzeniem aplikacji analitycznych.

Often facing the need to group observations? That's a good presentation for you.</p> <p>## Using R in palaeontology</p> <p>During the last years, data science (and R) became more and more popular in various areas of research. One of the probably most exotic domains of such usage is palaeontology. I'll show you a case study (coming directly from my PhD research), where domain expert knowledge is mixed with data science approach.<br/>Trilobites are one of the most fascinating extinct animals. Various shapes, sizes, environments, modes of life - all within one extinct group. Describing their systematics can lead to more complex conclusions about the shape of the whole ancient world. Trilobites from the Holy Cross Mountains are an excellent example of such importance. Laying between two major paleocontinents - Baltica and Gondwana - the exact position of this small area during Cambrian is still unclear.<br/>Studying trilobites can help in resolving this puzzle, but such old fossils suffer from various deformations, so the true diversity is hidden behind the 500 million years of history. In such cases, data science tools can help in removing the noise. I'll show you, how to use Principal Component Analysis with landmark-type data, how to remove bias, and how to interpret the results.</p> <p># Speakers bio</p> <p>Jakub Nowicki holds the PhD degree in Earth Sciences. He is an expert in morphometry and Cambrian trilobites.

Google PageSpeed Insights is one of the most important tools that can be used to create a ""healthcheck"" for a given URL address but using it for every single page in a website with thousands of pages will be tedious and error-prone.<br/>Thus I created R package pagespeedParseR that helps with automatization. It can send multiple requests to Google PageSpeed Insights API and parse the returned reports (nested lists) into data frames.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Leszek Sieminski is a digital marketing analyst, self-taught programmer &amp; R language enthusiast. Currently, he works in Performance Media Polska as a Digital Data Analyst.</p> <p># Automated Supply Chain Management<br/>Bio:<br/>Father of 3, after first life in IT (mainly C++ dev and project management), switched to operations in Renault Nissan then Lean &amp; Supply Chain Management at European level for Hutchinson ( Automotive). Lecturer at Politechnika Lódzka in Supply chain &amp; Production management. Machine Learning practitionner for 3 years and now founder at ArtInLean.<br/>The dream I am realizing is to build a platform that will erase all those stupid wastes in supply chain, specially for perishable food, securing my family needs while trying to leave this world not so spoiled to them.</p> <p>Description:<br/>I would like to share the journey I took to build from scratch a production grade machine learning workflow for automated stock and sales management, with emphasis on :</p> <p>1/ Hurdles in accessing/cleaning data at a commercial company and how I could overcome them<br/>2. How suprisingly fast it was for me to go from idea to working model in R<br/>3. How painful and key it is to make it production grade ( and one can in R too)<br/>4. Exchange with you on some principles I applied in my journey that helped a lot ( Lean start-up, Agile, continuous training, real passion for what I do...)<br/>5.

There are various reasons why missing data may occur, including survey non-response, unavailability of measurements, and lost data. In this presentation, I will first share my experience on how to do parametric estimation with missing covariates, based on likelihood methods and Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Then I will focus on recent results of variable selection in high-dimensional settings with missing observations among the covariates. To address this relatively understudied problem, we propose a new synergistic procedure – adaptive Bayesian SLOPE – which effectively combines the SLOPE method (sorted l1 regularization) together with the Spike-and-Slab LASSO method. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate satisfactory performance in terms of power, FDR and estimation bias under a wide range of scenarios. Finally, we analyze a real dataset consisting of patients from Paris hospitals who underwent a severe trauma, where we show excellent performance in predicting platelet levels.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Wei Jiang is currently pursuing PhD degree in Statistics at Ecole Polytechnique, France. Her research mainly focuses on statistical inference with missing values and applications on medical dataset. Fan of R, eager to learn more about data science and mathematics.</p> ","https://www.meetup.com/Spotkania-Entuzjastow-R-Warsaw-R-Users-Group-Meetup/events/265912453/"

Firstly, I will give you an overview about statistical modelling in non-life insurance pricing and its specialties. How can modern machine learning challenge the good old GLM world? What is the role of ML interpretability and explainability in this challenge? I will illustrate the ideas on a large real world motor claims data set.<br/>In the second part I’d like to share some thoughts on model-agnostic measures of interaction strength. How can they be used to efficiently measure overall interaction strength per input variable? How can shortcomings in current partial dependence related measures be mended?</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Michael Mayer is an enthusiastic statistician and R programmer working as non-life pricing actuary for “Die Mobiliar”, one of the most traditional and successful insurance companies in Switzerland. Since finishing his PhD at the University of Bern in 2008, Michael has worked as biostatistician, predictive modeler, statistics consultant as well as University lecturer.

Gyakran merül fel a kérdés, hogyan lehetne meghatározni az optimális csoportszámot. További gyakori kérdés az is hogy a csoportok között nemcsak hasonló, hanem a legnagyobb homogén csoportok is meghatározásra kerüljenek. A célok eléréséhez kidolgozásra került két hagyományos eljárást ötvözo technika, a kombinált klaszter- és diszkriminancia analízis (CCDA Kovács et al., 2014), amit olyan több származási helyrol elérheto, többdimenziós adatokra fejlesztettünk, ahol minden ilyen származási helyrol több megfigyelés történt. A CCDA a lineáris diszkriminancia analízis által helyesen klasszifikált esetek arányát egy véletlen beosztásból adódó- helyesen klasszifikált - arányszámhoz viszonyítja, illetve ezek különbségét nézi. Ezen értékeket tekintve objektív módon meghatározható az optimális csoportszám illetve a hozzá tartozó csoportosítás (Kovács és Eross, 2017) és páronkénti összehasonlítások alkalmazásával képes egy rendszerben meglévo legnagyobb különbségek kimutatására (Kovács et al., 2015; Tanos et al, 2016). Továbbá a CCDA képes nem csupán a hasonló (Déri–Takács et al., 2015), hanem homogén csoportok keresésére, a csoportok közötti legkisebb különbségek megtalálására is (Kovács et al., 2014; Kovács et al., 2015).""</p> <p>Kivételesen nagyon pontosan kezdünk, így érkezzetek 10 perccel 6 elott.

We are planning a more informal conversational event, where anyone can ask any questions – though we also try to prepare with few topics to be raised.</p> <p>If you are staggering a bit about recalling Hadley’s name, we can help where you might remember him from :) most probably you have already worked with him, or more accurate to say, with one of the R packages he has written. Among many others, he created the ggplot2 package, he is advocating the concept of tidy data through dplyr and tidyr, he facilitates our lives with the readr and readxl packages, and allows us easy webscraping through rvest. On top of it you can also remember his name as the main author of the book ""R for Data Science"".

Work hands-on with new packages and ways of doing things to achieve awesome models in many fewer lines of code.</p> <p>Using packages like dplyr, broom, modelr, recipes, h2o, and furrr we’ll see how we can go from getting data to having an amazing model in no time at all.</p> <p>This practical day will give people with experience in data science a new set of tools to implement and help them be more productive, whilst for people relatively new to data science it’ll help them get started quickly.</p> <p>About Steph</p> <p>Steph is the founder of a consultancy in the UK. Her talks, blog posts, conferences, and business all have one thing in common – they help people get started with data science. Steph holds the Microsoft MVP award for her community contributions.

From economic development, to healthcare, to education and public policy, we rely on numbers to allocate resources and make crucial decisions. But because so much data fails to take into account gender, because it treats men as the default and women as atypical, bias and discrimination are baked into our systems. And women pay tremendous costs for this bias, in time, money, and often with their lives.</p> <p>Celebrated feminist advocate Caroline Criado Perez investigates shocking root cause of gender inequality and research in Invisible Women†‹, diving into women’s lives at home, the workplace, the public square, the doctor’s office, and more. Built on hundreds of studies in the US, the UK, and around the world, and written with energy, wit, and sparkling intelligence, this is a groundbreaking, unforgettable exposé that will change the way you look at the world.""</p> ","https://www.meetup.com/rladies-austin/events/264290568/"
