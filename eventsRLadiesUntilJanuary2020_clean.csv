scientists we spend about 80 of our time moving cells rows and columns around to get them ready for a specific analytical procedure So to get more job done we must be efficient in data management We will look at two modern R packages dplyr and tidyr They are like a Swiss Army knife for a data scientist and we have low chances to survive in R community without them These packages allow us to produce more elegant code that leads to faster development and reduces risk of errors 30 minutes of Excel spreadsheet tasks can be completed with 3 lines of R code with these packages/p pThe meetup
